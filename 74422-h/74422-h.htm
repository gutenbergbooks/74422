<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>When we go into foreign countries we eagerly look for
those things that differ from our own, and if we do not
find oddities in dress, food, buildings, and customs we
are disappointed. But we are also disappointed if we do
not meet, in the people, the honesty and kindliness that
we expect from friends. We look for differences in surroundings,
but for likenesses in people. We wish to find
in people the traits that will make us feel at home among
strangers in a strange land. We wish to find friends even
though they are in strange garments.</p>

<p>The pictures in this book were drawn with the purpose
of showing differences in externals among peoples of
different nations. The stories were written to bring
home to us the likeness in heart among the boys and
girls of the world. A young Arab pommels his donkey’s
sides for joy because he is going on a holiday in Jerusalem.
A girl of Italy shares her Easter cake with a friend
who has none. An orphan boy with younger brothers
and sisters dependent upon him does his very best for
them in Poland as in the United States.</p>

<p>If most of the pictures were made from children in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
poor circumstances, or from those living in rural districts,
it is because the war left the countries of Europe
greatly impoverished, and because the beautiful old costumes
and habits are rapidly passing from city life and
are to be found only in out-of-the-way places. More and
more the differences among the children of the world are
vanishing, while the likenesses are growing.</p>

<p>The year 1916 found Miss Upjohn, artist of child life
and author of these stories, in Europe as a volunteer relief
worker. She once remarked that the only time in her
life when she had enough children to suit her was when
she was daily serving breakfast to four hundred soldier
boys in a Red Cross canteen in London. Later she
served in France with the Fraternité Américaine and
with the Fund for War Devastated Villages. While with
the latter, during the German offensive of March, 1918,
she helped to evacuate villages in the Canton of Rossières,
near Montdidier, Somme. For her service in this
connection she was decorated by the French Government.
But there are memories which the author treasures
even more than this—of the day, for example,
when, after two years’ absence, she went back to one of
those villages in the Somme and arrived to find the entire
population celebrating a requiem for their fallen.
Slipping into the church, she took a seat on a bench near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
the door, but the curé, recognizing her, came forward
from the altar and asked her to come up among them
because of all that they had been through together.
‘Such things made me feel,’ said Miss Upjohn, ‘that
they regarded me as one of themselves, in sympathy at
least.’</p>

<p>During the stress of this time, when often the inhabitants
left their villages from one side while the opposing
forces were entering from the other, she was deeply impressed
by the pluck and helpfulness of the French children.
A year later, while she was with the Red Cross
Commission in Czecho-Slovakia, the same spirit among
the Czech children, coupled with an active sympathy on
their part for others in distress, revealed to her the latent
power for peace in the children of the world, needing
only the threads of contact to bring about widespread
understanding.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that when, in 1920, she was asked to
enter the service of the American Junior Red Cross, she
accepted. She was commissioned first to portray child
life in those European countries which had been beneficiaries
of the service of the children of America. She has
since remained continuously with this organization,
traveling widely, indeed encircling the globe, in behalf of
world-wide understanding among children. The work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
her pen and brush has been an important factor in the
development of that children’s ‘league of friendship’
which now includes in its membership ten million boys
and girls in the schools of forty nations.</p>

<p>The stories in this book do not tell of children’s sufferings.
They bring before our eyes the children of many
nations in their everyday surroundings, everywhere
bravely and hopefully living and learning. Some of the
stories are quite true; and all of them have a kernel of
truth around which the artist-author, with the help of
very real children, has built them.</p>

<p>Wherever it was known that the drawings were to
take some message or story to the children of America,
there was a scramble to get into the picture. Often a
poor child would refuse to take payment for posing: ‘No,
no, I want to do it for <i>Them</i>!’ Perhaps a boy had received
a Christmas box or a letter; perhaps a girl had
known the unfamiliar comfort of hot food or warm shoes
during the pinched days of the war; or perhaps they had
simply heard that other children of their country, poorer
than themselves, had been helped.</p>

<p>‘It was a stirring thing to find,’ said Miss Upjohn,
‘that even in remote spots of the Balkans there existed
an image of American school-children as something
bright, kind, and companionable. In the heart of many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
a growing boy and girl in Albania or France or Czecho-Slovakia
the sympathy of American children is being
repaid a thousandfold in the golden gift of Friendship.’</p>

<p class="ph2">Friends in Strange Garments</p>

<p class="ph2">∵</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IN THE WILDERNESS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rahmeh’s</span> mother brought the smoking dish of mutton
and cauliflower from the clay brazier where it had been
cooking over a fire of thorns, and placed it in the middle
of the rug, on a large round straw tray. Then she laid
a little flat loaf of bread at each place and clapped her
hands to call the family to their meal.</p>

<p>Yussef and his father came in quickly, but Rahmeh
stayed outside to feed Nib, the camel, with the cauliflower
leaves that she had saved for him.</p>

<p>Nib was Rahmeh’s pet, and the great awkward beast
followed the little girl about like a lamb. He was on his
knees now, tied down to a peg in the ground to prevent
his wandering away. His melancholy, drooping eyes
watched the little figure coming toward him with hands
full of green; his loose gray lips trembled wistfully and
his teeth slid slowly back and forth as he moved his
jaws in anticipation. Close on Rahmeh’s heels came
Jeida, her little donkey, thrusting his nose over her
shoulder and sniffing enviously at the fresh leaves which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Nib tucked under his long lips. He looked on sulkily as
Rahmeh tied a blue bead to Nib’s collar and patted his
head, which felt like a mat of spongy moss. The blue
bead was a charm against the evil eye in the great city,
where so many strange and perhaps envious people
might look at Nib as he threaded his way through the
crowded streets; for he was about to make a journey up
to Jerusalem with his master and Yussef.</p>

<p>Rahmeh and Jeida longed for a real adventure like
going to Jerusalem. Sometimes they made short trips
to the orange groves of Jericho, or, with a load of vegetables,
to the British soldiers encamped on the shore of
the Dead Sea; but usually they herded sheep in the gullies.</p>

<p>Now Rahmeh helped her brother Yussef prepare for
the journey. She brought a long coat to put over his
white cotton garment. It was of striped black and yellow
and reached to his heels; a girdle of wine-colored
wool fastened it at the waist.</p>

<p>‘You must take your <i>abyah</i>, too, Yussef,’ said his
mother, ‘it will be snowing, up in Jerusalem.’</p>

<p>Yussef, looking up at the hot, blue sky, which stretched
over the Jordan Valley, laughed incredulously. But he
took the <i>abyah</i>, or woolen cloak, from its peg, hoping
that his mother might be right about the snow. It
would add another excitement to the trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>His father was already loading Nib with sacks of fruit
and nuts. From the saddle hung beautiful bags richly
woven by the children’s mother. Into these she now
stuffed bread and cheese and figs for the journey. At last
they were off over the white road that slipped away
among the folded hills, ashen gray, dun and blue, soft
as the wings of a dove.</p>

<p>Diab, the children’s father, was a rich man. Besides
the orange grove on the Plain of Jericho, he owned large
flocks of sheep and goats. In his house were fine rugs
and great bins for grain, reaching nearly to the ceiling.
The grain was poured in at the top and taken out through
a round hole near the bottom. Diab had rings of silver
and of gold, and his wife, the children’s mother, had such
a weight of coins on her headdress that it made her
head ache. On ordinary days she laid it aside and wore
imitation ornaments, which were lighter. Rahmeh, too,
had a string of coins across her forehead, and chains of
silver, which, fastened to her cap in front of her ears,
swung down under her chin.</p>

<p>Her mother had made her a little jacket of purple
velvet embroidered with orange, and her skirt was
worked with bands of flowers.</p>

<p>That night Ismail, the big brother, said: ‘Rahmeh,
you will have to go with me to the hills to-morrow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
There are too many little lambs for me to look after
them alone.’</p>

<p>Rahmeh was delighted. She rode her own little
donkey, Jeida, and carried a pocketful of dates and
bread. Jeida was chubby and serious; like his mistress,
he went unshod, and, like her, he wore gorgeous raiment,
for his saddlebags were hung with tassels of orange and
crimson and blue. He had, too, a necklace of large blue
beads, and a silver and blue ornament was hung over his
shaggy forelock for luck.</p>

<p>Ismail led the flock; and Rahmeh, mounted on Jeida,
rounded up the straying sheep from behind. Wherever
she saw a clump of thorns thick with Dead Sea apples,
she slid from Jeida’s back and gingerly plucked them
from the prickly mass. They looked like great beads of
amber. But they were filled with pith, and, strung on
a long strand of wool, would make a magnificent necklace
for Nib on his return. There was not a tree in sight—only
the pale sagebrush and the tangle of thorns and
a great waste of sandy hills dipping down to the Dead
Sea, which lay in its bowl of blue hills, a quiet, sunshiny
lake with hardly a ripple. Along the roadside,
patches of salt cropped to the surface and lay on the
brown earth as white as hoar frost.</p>

<p>Ismail led the flock back into the hills away from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Dead Sea. He separated the little lambs from the rest
of the flock and left them behind with Rahmeh in a
hidden ravine, which ran like a streak of life across the
immense gray wilderness. Rahmeh sat tossing and
counting her lapful of Dead Sea apples, wondering
whether father and Yussef had yet reached Jerusalem,
that great walled city nearly four thousand feet above
her, which to her imagination seemed to touch the sky.
Was the ground up there covered with that white
mysterious thing called snow, which never came to
them in the Jordan Valley?</p>

<p>Suddenly over the edge of the ravine the wind swept
a flock of small quail, all whirring and chirping, and
dropped them into the warm hollow. There they lay,
fluttering and bewildered, but so tame that Rahmeh
could easily have caught them. She looked up at the
sky. The wind must be blowing up there, she thought,
and then she heard Ismail calling. He was coming over
the top of the hill carrying three little long-legged black
lambs, and behind him trooped the rest of the flock,
black, white, and brown, tinkling and bleating and
nibbling at the shrubs as they passed.</p>

<p>‘Rahmeh,’ said Ismail, ‘there’s a storm coming. You
had better start ahead on Jeida and take these three
little fellows who are too weak to walk. I can bring in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the rest.’ Ismail dropped two of the lambs into the
bags attached to Jeida’s saddle and gave the third one
to Rahmeh to carry across her lap. ‘Take the Dead
Sea road,’ he called after her.</p>

<p>Jeida chose a sheep track to the top of the ravine and
from there a stony way, like the bed of a torrent, which
ran down into the valley. He dropped nimbly from
boulder to boulder until they came down to the sand-dunes
which lie about the end of the Dead Sea, now
dark as slate between its rocky shores.</p>

<p>The sky was heavy with gray clouds. As they came
over a hill that was like a great bare dune, Rahmeh felt
Jeida suddenly quiver under her; then snorting with
terror he plunged down the hill, and, not stopping to
pick his way, made straight for the valley road. Casting
a swift glance backward, Rahmeh saw what seemed to
be a large fierce dog just over the brow of the next sand-dune.
He was following them in a crooked, skulking
way, his head down, but his evil yellow eyes turned
upward. He was striped with bands of yellow across
his shoulders. A mane of coarse, bristling hair stood
upright.</p>

<p>Rahmeh’s heart gave a great thump of fright, for she
realized that this was a hyena and that he was after the
lambs; after Jeida, too, perhaps; for though hyenas are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
great cowards, they do sometimes attack donkeys and
other animals that cannot fight. Jeida, sweating and
trembling and galloping wildly toward the valley road,
was not more frightened than Rahmeh. All the dark
stories she had ever heard about hyenas came back to
her—that they stole lambs from the fold and babies
from the cradle; that they even stole your <i>mind</i>, until
you were forced to follow wherever they went. Rahmeh
tightened her hold on the lamb in her lap until its little
round head pressed tightly against her chest, and leaning
over caught Jeida’s neckband with both hands. It is
probable that if she had not been an Arab child she
would not have held on at all. Of course if she had
dropped the lamb on the road the hyena would have
stopped following, in order to devour it; but Rahmeh
was too good a shepherdess even to think of such a
thing. Her one idea was to protect and save the lamb.</p>

<p>Until now Jeida had kept ahead, but he was winded
and trembling, and suddenly stumbling, he came down
on his knees, almost throwing Rahmeh over his head.</p>

<p>At the same time the hyena, leaving the shelter of
the sand-dunes, circled about to head them off. He was
very near now, humping his shoulders in an ugly fashion,
and showing his fangs. The lambs bleated with terror.</p>

<p>Then, as Rahmeh shut her eyes in a spasm of fright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and Jeida, regaining his feet, jerked backward on quivering
flanks, there came the sharp crack of a rifle, and with
a yelp the hyena rolled over in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>A man in khaki came running over the dunes, rifle
in hand. He was an English soldier who, on his way to
camp, had seen the peril of the little shepherdess.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he cried, ‘don’t be afraid!’ But Rahmeh
and Jeida were already fleeing toward the gray house
where there were sheltering walls, a well of cold water,
and mother.</p>

<p>The next day Rahmeh stayed at home and strung the
Dead Sea apples into a magnificent necklace, not for
big Nib, but for brave little Jeida.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PIGEON MOSQUE</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">If</span> I could write like that,’ thought Omar enviously,
‘I’d send a letter to my brother in America, telling him
how I went out on the Bosphorus in a boat and caught
seven fish.’</p>

<p>He was watching the spectacled old Turk, who sat
all day in the court of the Pigeon Mosque, writing for
those who did not know how. Omar had been to school,
where, sitting on straw mats with the other boys,
weaving his body to and fro as they recited in unison,
he had learned parts of the Koran by heart; but he had
never learned to write. If the fat merchant who was
dictating to the scribe could not write his own letters,
why should Omar? And if every one knew this art, how
would the old man earn his living?</p>

<p>Fatima, Omar’s sister, did not worry about such
things. None of the girls whom she knew ever went to
school. She sat feeding the pigeons, glad of every day
before her mother should make her hang a thick black
veil across her face when she went for water. But the
big brother who had gone to Chicago wrote home that
there all the children could read and write, even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
little ones. He was shocked at Omar’s ignorance.
That was why Omar hung about the old Turk every day,
watching him make the quick little marks that meant
words.</p>

<p>When the merchant in the red fez had paid his money
and gone, Omar ventured timidly. ‘I think I could
make those letters,’ he said, ‘but I don’t know what they
mean.’</p>

<p>‘Boy,’ answered the Turk, ‘you must not come here
to pick up crumbs like the pigeons. If you wish to
learn, I will teach you; but you must work.’</p>

<p>After that, every day for months Omar might have
been seen sitting on the step at the feet of the scribe,
laboriously penning quirls and dots and dashes, and
learning to form them into words. Gradually he came
to know the meaning of the texts written in white and
gold on the green and blue tiles of the mosque, and to
love the place as he never had before.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant school, under the sky. In the center
was a beautiful covered fountain with a tiled roof resting
on white columns. The doors of the mosque were of
dull green bronze, and its walls were a blend of ivory
and apricot-tinted marbles, with rich tiles let into them.
Beyond the gateway of the court a white minaret shot
toward the turquoise sky, and an old plane tree covered
with button balls harbored hundreds of pigeons which
drifted down to the court in search of food.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">WRITING FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The mosque had a quaint story, too. The Sultan
Bajesid, who built it to be buried in, was a stingy man,
and although he wished the mosque to be very beautiful,
the money gave out long before it was finished; so the
people of Constantinople were asked to contribute.
One poor widow, who had nothing to give but a pair of
pigeons, brought them as her offering. The Sultan was
pleased, and ordered that the birds be left in the court
as an example of generosity. That was four hundred
years ago, and now the gray pigeons, descendants of
the original pair, hover in clouds about the mosque and
give it its name. But though the old Sultan was a miser,
he was no coward. In token of that, when he was at last
buried in his mosque, his people placed under his arm
a brick made of the dust shaken from his garments—a
sign that he had been no slacker, but had fought in the
dust of battle.</p>

<p>‘That was Bajesid’s idea of playing the game,’ said
the scribe. ‘Now, your battle is to learn to read and
write, and you must not be a slacker either if you use
Bajesid’s mosque as a schoolhouse.’</p>

<p>When Omar was not learning these things from the
old Turk, he was studying the signs on the shops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the numbers on the street cars. He had no paper or
books, but he copied letters and figures on bits of brick
and plaster, and worked hard.</p>

<p>One day he saw a man, poorly dressed and carrying
a package, looking anxiously at the signs over the bazaars.
Now and then he stopped people to show them
a written paper, but they shook their heads and hurried
on, for they could not read. Omar approached the man
shyly.</p>

<p>‘Let me see if I can read it,’ he said. As he looked at
the characters they seemed alive, for he had studied
the same words and numbers on a signboard in another
part of the city.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know what it means and will take you to the
place,’ said Omar.</p>

<p>The man was so grateful that when he delivered the
package to the merchant to whom it belonged, he said,
‘Had it not been for this boy, who can read, I should
not have found you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you can read, can you?’ said the merchant
thoughtfully. ‘That is good. If you wish a job with me
I can give you one.’</p>

<p>Omar replied that he did not yet know enough to
stop studying. ‘But,’ he added, ‘if you will employ me
half a day I will study the other half.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>‘Very well,’ said the merchant, ‘the more you know,
the greater value you will have for me.’</p>

<p>So at last Omar could write proudly to his brother in
Chicago, ‘See! I have begun, and now I do not intend
to let those American boys get ahead of me!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ROAD TO ARCADIA</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> boys sat matching pennies on the floor of a temple—the
ruined temple of Hera in the ancient Greek city
of Olympia. They were little boys, all in short trousers,
and Theo and Alexander in the long-sleeved blue aprons
worn by boys in the primary grades of school. Spiro and
Andreas, a little older, wore brown woolen capes and
little caps with tassels. Adoni, the oldest, had finished
the primary school and wore a <i>fustanella</i>, that is, a full
white kilt, which stood out like a ballet dancer’s skirt.
On his shoes were black pompons like his father’s.</p>

<p>The ruined temple was a favorite place to play, for
the boys were very proud of the fact that it was one of
the famous spots of the earth. Among the blackberry
vines and the daisies, great blocks of marble lay about,
like fallen checker towers on a carpet. The boys knew
the stories about the wilderness of buildings, which
were now marked only by foundation lines or rows of
broken columns. Here the great Olympic Games had
been begun more than two thousand years ago—the
games that have been revived in our time, and in which
it is such an honor to take part. To these boys the
olden games seemed very real and the ancient place
very living.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe25" id="i_014_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_014_facing.jpg" alt="FIVE BOYS SAT MATCHING PENNIES ON THE FLOOR OF
A TEMPLE">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">FIVE BOYS SAT MATCHING PENNIES ON THE FLOOR OF
A TEMPLE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Tired of matching pennies, they took off their shoes
and sprang to a paved spot near by, where they began
to wrestle. In the gymnasium that had once stood here,
the Olympic athletes had begun their training. The
pavement of tile was grooved, to keep the wrestlers
from slipping, and as the five boys tussled, their bare
feet gripped the friendly tiles.</p>

<p>When they stopped their play, out of breath, Theo
caught sight of the figure of a stranger, and all of them
turned to look, abashed. From where they stood they
could not tell whether it was that of a man or a woman,
for the person sat low in the grass. A gray coat collar
was turned up to the ears and a black cap pulled down,
against a keen breeze that set the delicate iris aquiver
and rippled the daisies on their stems.</p>

<p>The boys stood for a moment full of curiosity, then
began to jump forward from stone to stone, pretending
to look for blackberries, but really closing in on the
stranger. When they came near they saw that it was a
woman, and that a paint box lay open at her side. She
looked up and smiled, and a sigh of relief went up from
the boys. She was not going to drive them away. Instead,
she held out her hand and said ‘Good day’ in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
their own tongue. This greeting appeared to be all the
Greek that she knew, so the boys could only smile back
at her and shake hands.</p>

<p>They would have liked to talk to her and tell her the
stories about the ruins. They pointed to a fallen archway
to show her the entrance to the famous stadium
where races had taken place—a stretch of level ground
now covered with wheat fields and olive trees, beneath
which lay the great race course where the chariots had
whirled and the spot where the victors had received their
olive branches.</p>

<p>In the old days there had been no money prizes and
no decorations. No professional runners or boxers or
wrestlers were allowed to take part in the Olympic
Games. It was a fair contest, for all the players had
the same training, ten months in the gymnasium where
the boys had just been wrestling. July was the month
for the Games; and no matter what quarrels or wars
there might be between the states of Greece, during that
month they were forgotten. Peace was sworn, and all
Greeks came together as brothers. It was not only the
Greeks who gathered; people from other countries
were welcomed, too, for in Olympia the word ‘stranger’
was sacred. To harm or cheat a guest was the meanest
of crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The five boys stood around the artist, and their
courteous bearing seemed to show that they kept to the
great tradition of the Games. Adoni jerked his head
back scornfully and pointed to a row of large stones
near by. On those blocks had once stood statues called
<i>zanes</i>, paid for by the fines of contestants who had not
‘played the game.’ The largest one perpetuated the
shame of a boy who had run away the night before the
race in which he was to take part, because he had been
afraid of failing. That was more than fifteen hundred
years ago! The artist nodded and said ‘Zanes!’ and the
boys knew that she understood.</p>

<p>They drew closer to watch her as she sketched. Along
the road to Arcadia, on the embankment above them,
a broken line of people, on foot and on donkey-back,
were passing on their way home from market. It made
a bright moving picture in the sunlight, but it was not
easy to paint. Before one donkey was finished, another
had trotted into his place in the picture. The boys
laughed when the waggly ears of one donkey were placed
on another one that had passed out of sight. Orange
and black saddlebags took the place of a wooden saddle
that had been hung with bunches of onions and carrots;
and one woman was painted with another woman’s
baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Quite as fascinating were the materials with which the
artist worked—sticks of charcoal, a soft eraser, which
could be squeezed like putty between the fingers, and
a box full of tiny porcelain dishes filled with bright
colors, besides tubes from which soft paint could be
pressed on a tin plate and mixed with water. The box
lay on the grass close by the artist’s knee, and the boys
longed to look it over, but were too shy and too well-bred
to touch the things.</p>

<p>Andreas, looking up from watching this diverting
business, spied two older boys coming toward their
group. Uneasily the younger boys recognized Petro
Negroponte, who was always bullying them on the
school playground and elsewhere. The big boys lounged
onto the scene and stood staring, their hands in their
pockets. To show that they were not impressed by
what was going on, they began to make scornful remarks,
at which the little boys grinned nervously,
hoping that after all they might be allowed to stay.</p>

<p>But Petro had no intention of letting them enjoy
themselves. ‘Here, get out of this, you!’ he said
roughly. As the five stood irresolute, he raised his arm
threateningly.</p>

<p>‘Go!’ he commanded.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the little boys turned away and began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
to play leap-frog in an open space where once had stood
an altar to the great god Zeus. Looking back wistfully,
they saw something that made them stop their game in
horror.</p>

<p>The big boys, too, had moved away. One of them
was halfway up the embankment, but Petro Negroponte
had slipped behind the tree under which the artist sat.
Suddenly his hand shot out, and the next instant he and
his pal were dashing up the embankment and along the
road to Arcadia.</p>

<p>‘My paint box!’ cried the artist, springing to her feet.
She spoke in English, but the little boys understood.
Their own particular stranger had appealed to them for
help! Forgetting their fear, they started in full cry after
the thieves.</p>

<p>Along the stony road to Arcadia they ran, the artist
panting far behind. Shepherds waved to show which
direction the fugitives had taken. Men in the field
shouted encouragement, but no one joined the chase.</p>

<p>What the boys feared, happened. Petro and his
companion made for a thick wood on a cliff above the
road. There, rocks and brush made pursuit almost impossible.
With thumping hearts and dry throats, the
little boys scrambled up the steep incline and out of
sight of the artist on the road below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>It was a long half-hour before they came sliding down
the hill, dusty and sweating. Andreas carried the paint
box, but it was empty. All of the boys were silent and
ashamed, because they had failed, but, most of all, because
a Greek boy had betrayed a stranger. There were
still <i>zanes</i> in Olympia!</p>

<p>The sun was dropping low. It touched the sheep in
the meadows, rimming each one of them with silver.
The road to Arcadia still lay in sunshine, and over it the
little procession turned back.</p>

<p>Suddenly Spiro pounced on something lying in a rut—a
stick of charcoal! Instantly five pairs of eyes
sharpened, searching the edges of the road. Patiently
they went over the course step by step, and shouts of
triumph punctured the twilight when a lead pencil or
a tube of paint was found among the rocks. At the top
of the embankment, where Petro had stumbled over a
pine root, they found the most. The box had slipped
and, having no cover, many of the paints had dropped
from it.</p>

<p>Eagerly the boys gathered the lost tubes. Not the
very smallest piece of charcoal was withheld, not even
the fascinating lump of rubber which trembled in
Alexander’s grimy little hand, nor the empty porcelain
pans which Adoni picked out of the moss. At the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of the search, a handful of odds and ends had been
gathered, precious little bits of red and yellow and green
saved from the wreck.</p>

<p>Then, since words meant little between them and
their stranger, boys and artist smiled at each other in
the dusk, in perfect understanding as they all shook
hands again.</p>

<p>The honor of Olympia was clear when the wind and
the sun went down at the end of the valley.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CHRISTMAS LANTERNS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nikola</span> usually began his day by fetching two jars of
fresh water for his mother. He filled them at the public
fountain, loaded them on his donkey, and then he and
the donkey trotted home along the sea wall.</p>

<p>Nikola lived in a village of stone, which led up the
side of a cliff to a plateau of rocks and thistles. Ages
ago the sea had raged through here and had worn big
caves in the cliff. In some of these caves people lived,
having made them into houses by building walls in
front of them, with windows and a door, and sufficient
roof to hold a chimney, which was really nothing more
than a big water jug the bottom of which had been
broken out. Up the stone stairs, which served as a street,
women toiled daily with similar jars on their shoulders.
If they were tired, all they had to do was to sit down
and rest on the flat roof of a house.</p>

<p>Over these steps Nikola skipped one hot winter’s
morning to lead out his little flock of sheep, penned in
a cave higher up. What a place of stones and thistle
it was! But farther back from the sea there was more
grass, and thither Nikola guided his flock. From below
they were plainly visible against the dark sky.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_022_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">HE AND THE DONKEY TROTTED HOME ALONG THE SEA WALL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>A boy coming along the road saw them and smiled
craftily. ‘I’ll get ahead of that fellow,’ he said to himself.
It was Philippu, coming from the town with a roll
of colored tissue paper in his hand. Nikola on the hilltop,
unmindful of Philippu’s presence, stretched himself
vigorously, flinging out his arms against the sky.
One arm pointed toward Mount Ida, where the Greek
god Zeus was born, the other toward Mount Jukta
where he died. But that meant nothing to Nikola. He
was so used to the glorious mountains that he paid no
attention to them. He sat down and considered what
could be done about the holidays. The Greeks have a
different calendar from ours, so that Christmas and
New Year’s come thirteen days later with them than
with us. Consequently it was a day in early January
When Nikola was thus making plans for Christmas.</p>

<p>It is the custom in Greece for boys to go about from
house to house, singing carols on Christmas and New
Year’s Eve just as the waits do in England. They carry
lanterns, usually fancy ones, which they make themselves
in order to show that they have taken pains to
attract and please and are not begging. Rather, they
are carrying a little portable show, and they sing so
lustily that people are either pleased to hear them or
glad to pay them a few pennies to move on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Nikola had learned to his disgust that Philippu, besides
making a bagpipe from a sheep’s bladder, was
planning a large lantern in the shape of a boat. This
was just what Nikola himself had thought to do, and for
which he had already made a rough drawing from a ship
going to Alexandria, which had lain off the harbor for a
day. But now there was nothing left for him but to
make a lantern in the form of a house. Or should it be
a church, with two towers and a dome?</p>

<p>In his heart Nikola felt that he would make a failure
of the dome. So after all it must be a house. But he
would make a very large one indeed, and put five or six
candle ends in it. A green house with red windows and
a big yellow door! Over the door he would put a flagpole
and hang out the Greek flag, a white cross on a blue
ground. Superb! He rolled on his back for joy, his feet
high in the air. His thick brown <i>burnous</i> kept the
thistles from pricking his back.</p>

<p>And then what should he buy with all the money he
would earn? As he thought it over he seemed to have
few needs. Goat’s milk in the morning, plenty of olives
with his bread at noon, and at night a dish of hot greens
with oil and the juice of a lemon poured over them.
What more could one wish?</p>

<p>On the whole a cake for his mother, such as was customary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
at this time, brown and drenched with honey
and studded with nuts and candied fruits, would be the
best. He fondly hoped that it might be big enough for
the whole family.</p>

<p>Nikola had a few coppers, which he had earned by
carrying luggage down to the dock, and with these he
proposed to buy tissue paper to cover the framework of
his house. The next day, with a bundle of sticks, some
glue and strings, he repaired to a windless cave and
there began the fabrication of the wonderful lantern,
while the sheep browsed among the rocks outside. The
size and magnificence of his project Nikola kept secret,
hoping to stun Philippu with it on the final night. But
as he worked, he thought with envious concern that
Philippu had not only his bagpipe with which to win
fame and wealth, but the boat, too.</p>

<p>However, one cannot pipe and chant at the same
time, and Philippu must find someone else to do his
singing for him. Nikola had a good voice. He sang in
the choir and knew the fine old carols. This was a great
advantage over the boys who had only jazz to fall back
on.</p>

<p>Philippu and Nikola were in reality good friends.
It was only the competition in the matter of lanterns
that had brought a sharp rivalry between them. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
lived just outside the town of Candia on the Island of
Crete. The town was surrounded by great walls, built
by the Venetians when they were masters of the island
centuries ago. Inside the walls were modern shops
and hotels and market-places. A big restaurant, a few
small ones and many coffee-houses were the hope of the
boys.</p>

<p>Secretly each of them reconnoitered the field before
the great night, and each decided that about half-past
seven would be the most favorable time to sing before
the big restaurant. It would be a mistake to go too
early, for then the place would not be full; but if it was
too late people would have parted with all their small
change.</p>

<p>Accordingly, soon after dark on Christmas Eve,
Nikola set forth with his wonderful house. His mother
had given him four good candle ends, and he had two
more in his pocket when these should have given out.
He lighted his lantern before leaving home, in order that
his parents and Daphne might see it, and then proceeded
triumphantly down the road, carrying the brilliant
fabrication in both arms, with an admiring retinue of
small boys following.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the town wall their
pride met a check. Philippu had gone ahead in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
dark, his lantern unlit; but here, before entering the
town, he had stopped to light the candles; and now he
stood with the wonderful ship in his arms, his bagpipe
hung round his neck by a string. He was waiting for
his singer, who was late.</p>

<p>The ship was a marvel. The boys gaped at it in
amazement. It had four smokestacks and an imposing
double row of portholes. On either side of the bows
blazed the name ‘Hellas’ in letters of fire, and the rigging
was thickly festooned with tiny pennants of many
nations. Nikola’s house was bigger and brighter, but
the ship was an artistic triumph.</p>

<p>‘Hello!’ said Philippu coolly; ‘made a house, did you?’
There was something patronizing in his tone that irritated
Nikola. Besides, the fickle crowd was pressing
around Philippu’s boat in unfeigned admiration, and
Nikola decided to move on before they all left him.</p>

<p>‘That’s a fine ship,’ he said carelessly. ‘Well, come
on, boys; we’ll hurry up to the restaurant.’</p>

<p>‘Second turn for you,’ cried Philippu hotly. ‘I got
here first!’</p>

<p>‘But you’re not ready, and I am,’ retorted Nikola.
‘Come on, boys.’</p>

<p>In dismay Philippu saw his rivals rushing past him,
and though still without a singer he joined in the race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
for the best position. But he moved too swiftly. A
wind-blown tongue of flame licked at the ship’s rigging
and instantly the Christmas lantern shot up in a blaze.
Despairingly Philippu flung it from him. The masterpiece
fell to the ground, where it blazed and curled and
blackened and went up in smoke. With a cry of rage
Philippu sprang at Nikola; but Nikola had foreseen
this and had set his house on the wall. He met Philippu
halfway and caught him by the wrists. Both were
muscular boys, and for a moment they rocked back and
forth, grinding their teeth, while the small boys cheered
for joy.</p>

<p>‘Stop! Stop!’ shouted Nikola above the noise, still
holding Philippu by the wrists. ‘I didn’t hit you and
I’m sorry your boat is burned. But you’ve still got your
bagpipe. You play and I’ll sing. We’ll go halves.’</p>

<p>Philippu knew that the proposition was a generous
one, considering that Nikola now had the field to himself
and could make a good thing of it. There would be
other bands of singers, of course, but they would probably
carry Chinese lanterns and it was not likely that
anyone could outdo Nikola’s house and his fine voice.
He dropped his arms and stood back panting.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he said at last, ‘and next week I’ll make
another stunner.’ He bent over the wreck of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
‘Hellas’ and extricated the candle ends from the smouldering
rubbish. They would serve another day. So
Philippu really gathered himself together finely after
his disaster, though he could not restrain a groan as he
turned away from the ruin of his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Outside the restaurant the boys looked the field over
carefully, before beginning their campaign. Through
the lighted windows they could see that the large room
was nearly full of people eating. Philippu tested his
bagpipe and Nikola looked well to his candles, that none
of them should topple over. Then they engaged a small
boy who had a pair of copper cymbals to clap for them,
promising him five cents from their earnings. Thus they
had the rudiments of a brass band. Nikola set the
illuminated house on the sill of the restaurant window
where it made a magnificent showing in the dark street.
Then he opened the door a hand’s breadth and the concert
began. Strong and clear the young voice rang out
in the night. Philippu piped and the small partner
clashed his cymbals with terrific energy. People stopped
eating to listen, and every one craned to get a look at
the glowing house in the window. At last Nikola with
a flushed face and beating heart advanced into the
restaurant with a little saucer, which he had slipped into
his pocket from his mother’s cupboard. He had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
thought that he should mind so much. But as he went
from table to table and people dropped pennies smilingly
into his plate, he forgot his shyness and thanked everybody
joyfully, not trying to conceal his delight and surprise.</p>

<p>Outside, the boys counted their gains by the light of
the Christmas lantern. Over three <i>drachmas</i> had come
to them from their first attack. Up the street they went
to further triumphs, followed by an ever-increasing
train of admirers.</p>

<p>At last, all their candles burned, they sat down on the
edge of the old fountain in the square, and again took
stock. Nine <i>drachmas</i> and sixty <i>lepta</i>, after the cymbalist
had been paid! Visions of cake now became possibilities.
Rushing to the still open cake shop, they sang
and piped lustily to the baker, and then throwing their
coins on the counter ordered the best cake they could
get for their money.</p>

<p>That is how it happened that on Christmas Day the
members both of Nikola’s and of Philippu’s families
ate their fill of sticky brown cake, thick with plums and
almonds, with figs and dates and currants, all trickling
with honey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DRAGA’S ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening Draga and her brother Dushan squatted
on the kitchen floor, eating their supper of stewed
peppers smothered in clabbered milk, while their mother
prepared the thick, sweet Turkish coffee over a stone
brazier. Above them spread the hearth-hood, dark and
velvety as a bat’s wing. Wisps of blue smoke from their
father’s pipe floated toward it.</p>

<p>Of late many exciting things had happened. Father
had come back from America with new clothes, a new
language, and new ideas. Now the family sat silent in
the grip of a great decision.</p>

<p>Dushan and Draga were to go to the American school
in Monastir to learn English and other things not taught
in their village. Father had been to town to make arrangements,
and, since Dushan and Draga could show
good reports from their home school, they were to be
admitted on trial, Dushan to live with friends and attend
as a day pupil, Draga to live in the dormitory as
a boarder. Mother acquiesced bewildered, but her dark
eyes lingered on Draga, who was her baby. She listened
with considerable distrust to the tales of American
women who went where and when they liked—tales<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
even of girls who went to and from school alone on street
cars, carrying their books under their arms!</p>

<p>The preparations were finished. They were to start
the next morning. It would be a three days’ journey in
the ox-cart, and provisions stood ready in the shape of
baskets of grapes and cheese, and a great loaf of brown
bread, almost as big as a cart-wheel, wrapped in clean
linen. The heavy white tunics with their flowered borders
were folded between home-woven blankets.</p>

<p>After coffee, taking two baskets, Draga went to the
stream which bounded down toward Lake Prespa, to
gather succulent leaves and grass for the goats. The
village houses were deep ochre in color, some with
jutting windows faced with turquoise blue. Above the
walls which shut the gardens from the street rose cypresses
and matted vines and the wide tops of fig trees.
Scarped blue mountains climbed behind the village,
and below it lay Lake Prespa, holding in its bright waters
a tiny island on which could be seen the ruins of a tower
where long ago the Bulgarian Tsars had hidden their
treasure from the Greek Emperors of Constantinople.
That was before the time of the Serbian Tsars who conquered
Macedonia, or the Turks who took it from the
Serbs.</p>

<p>In this country Alexander the Great had lived as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
boy, and since then it had known so many masters and
was still claimed by so many nations that people continued
to live in fortress-like houses whose doors were
barred at night with heavy stanchions.</p>

<p>Draga’s home was one of these houses. All its doors
and windows opened on the inner court. On the ground
floor were stalled the oxen, the hens, and the goats.
Above the stables projected a wide veranda hung with
gay Serbian rugs and strings of tobacco and beans.
Below, in the open space of the court, was piled husked
corn, which glowed like a heap of gold when the sun
struck it.</p>

<p>Draga’s thoughts rushed back to the familiar scene
the next day, as the ox-cart creaked through the sere
and dusty country, over a road that had once been a
great Roman thoroughfare. It was really a continuation
of the famous Appian Way from Rome to Brindisi.
There it disappeared in the Adriatic, to emerge on the
other side at Durazzo, in Albania, where it took another
name, of Via Egnatia, and continued across country to
Salonica. Monastir, where Draga and Dushan were to
go to school, was the halfway station. The old Roman
road was still the great highway, but the merchant
caravans and the trampling legions had disappeared.
Military trucks, white with dust, sometimes lumbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
by, carrying stores to some outlying garrison, and the
mail car was sure to be met sooner or later jacking up
its wheels for new tires. For the most part, people went
by on foot or on donkey-back, all burden-laden.</p>

<p>There were brigands back in the hills. Sometimes
they disguised themselves as Turkish women, with long,
black veils over their faces, and flowing garments, which
concealed weapons; but persons traveling in an ox-cart
driven by a barefooted boy had nothing to fear. Nevertheless,
they spent the nights near some small village
that looked like an outcrop of stones on the hillside, and
after coffee and sour milk at the inn, stretched themselves
out on the floor of the wagon and pulled the
blankets over them.</p>

<p>On the third day they came to Monastir—to Draga
and Dushan a bewildering, beautiful place. The next
day was market day, and their mother could go back
in company with friends. So, on the threshold of the
school, with many hurried embraces, she left Draga,
who felt small and alone in spite of the crowd of new
faces around her.</p>

<p>A month went by and the first examinations were over.</p>

<p>Draga’s parents were to come that day to learn
whether or not she had passed. Draga did not know and
was afraid to ask. One moment she trembled with hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
that she had not passed, so that she might travel back
in the ox-cart with her parents to the golden-lighted
court, the shadowy kitchen, and the sweet, musty smell
of grapes. Then she shriveled with shame at the thought
of failure. Besides, she was beginning to love the school
life; the fresh clean dormitory, where they slept with
open windows; the team work of study and play; and
the evening hour, when they all sat on the floor and told
stories before going to bed. Also, she had learned with
surprise that Bulgarian girls are as kindly as Serbians.
There were several in the school, and one of them,
Boiana, had been her friend from the start. This
seemed strange, for she had always heard that Bulgars
were evil and hostile people.</p>

<p>Fearing that her mother might find her strange because
of her bobbed hair and straight gingham dress,
Draga put on her Macedonian garments. The embroidery
on her tunic was of an ancient pattern called
‘Marko, the King’s Son,’ so named in honor of the
Serbian prince, Marko, the national hero of chivalry and
romance, who had lost a crown rather than tell a lie.
His home had been in Macedonia over five hundred
years before Draga’s time, but ‘Marko’s pattern’ had
been handed down from one generation of Serbian
women to another, each proud to wear it, as Draga was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to-day. The sleeveless jacket which she wore over her
tunic was of a clear red, like the peppers strung against
the white walls of her home; and wound around her waist
was a rope of black wool to keep her brilliant girdle in
place.</p>

<p>Behind the school playground there was a high brick
wall with a small green door. It led into a quiet, neglected
garden like a scene from a book. There was a
well in the center; gourds and spiked flowers, purple and
white, grew in the rank grass, and crooked plum trees
traced blue shadows on the walls which shut the garden
away from the clatter of the streets. This was the paradise
of a large family of rabbits, and when Draga felt
homesick she slipped away to feed them with scraps of
red peppers, which she begged from the cook; for all
Macedonians down to the rabbits love peppers.</p>

<p>Draga had begun to feel the charm of order and
cleanliness, but she missed the animals which were a
part of the family at home, and which she had fed and
cared for all her life. She was torn between a longing to
go back to her home and a real love for the life in school.
Her examination marks would decide which it was to be.
Of her Serbian studies she felt fairly sure. It was the
strange English language that staggered her—its incomprehensible
verbs, its spelling without a clue. Some
of the Serbian girls spoke it well, and from them she
learned more than from her books. The queer names for
food and clothes and the objects in the schoolroom she
was beginning to master.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>While the rabbits were nibbling their peppers someone
came running to the green door. ‘Draga, your
father and mother are here!’</p>

<p>Her mother bent over her, enveloped her in the soft
white folds of her headdress, and smothered her with
kisses. ‘Oh, what a clever girl to pass in everything,
even the strange English!’ she whispered, and her
father’s eyes shone proudly upon her.</p>

<p>Suddenly Draga knew how glad she was to stay, how
proud that she could hold her place among the other
girls; and she realized that her parents too, as much as
they missed her, would rather leave her than take her
back. Together they were all working for the future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE TRUCE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Rastem was born his father hung a gun and a
cartridge belt on the wall for him. There they were to
stay until Rastem was fourteen years old, when he
would take them down himself and wear the belt and
carry the gun for the first time. Meanwhile, he began
his life in a little painted cradle, into which his mother
strapped him so tightly that he could move neither legs,
arms nor head, but lay like a little mummy, completely
covered with a rough homespun blanket.</p>

<p>Rastem lived in Albania, the land of the mountain
eagle. His home was in a strange old town perched so
high on a mountain-top that the clouds hung over it like
a dark flat roof so that the cocks crowed all day, as they
do when calling the hens to shelter from a storm.</p>

<p>Rastem’s father was a well-to-do man, and the family
lived in a pleasant house the plastered walls of which
were painted with birds and foliage. There were many
slatted windows and a cheery tiled roof with broad
eaves.</p>

<p>Next door to Rastem lived Marko, a boy of about his
own age. Though their families never visited each
other, and though the gate between the two yards was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
kept locked, the two little boys had discovered one
another as soon as they began to walk; and gazing
through the openings in the fence of woven branches
that separated them, they had quickly come to an
understanding. Later on, they worried a passage under
the hedge through which they crawled freely to pass
long hours of play together. They did not understand
why at first Marko was scowled at when he went to
Rastem’s house and Rastem was scowled at when he
went to Marko’s house; but as neither of the boys was
contented long without the other, their elders soon let
them go and come as they liked.</p>

<p>When they grew older and mingled with other children
they found out what the trouble was. Between the two
families there was what in Albania is called a blood feud;
that is, someone in Marko’s family had shot someone
in Rastem’s family during a quarrel, and had killed him.
It had happened a long time before. The man who
had shot the other had fled to a foreign country and his
children had grown up there; but until someone in Rastem’s
family shot a man in Marko’s family the feud
could not end, nor was the honor of Rastem’s family
clear.</p>

<p>That old quarrel of the grown people seemed a far-off,
foolish thing to the boys, and no concern of theirs. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
looked into each other’s eyes and grinned in perfect comradeship
when the larger boys urged them to fight it out
together. There was too much fun to be had out of life
to waste time in quarreling; and Kruja, that strange old
town, was not a bad place to grow up in. Its one long,
curving street, which skirted the mountain-side like a
tail, was crowded with open booths and was so narrow
that the roofs met overhead. Here on market days were
the clack and tap of little hoofs as the donkeys pushed
through the crowd with broad loads of hides and wood or
with saddlebags stuffed with lambs or a baby or two.
And there the coppersmiths beat out trays and water
pots before one’s eyes. The shoemakers cut the delicately
curved slippers from scarlet or orange or black
leather, the hatters shaped a white or red fez over a
block of wood, and artificers in silver polished pistol
handles as thickly set with bright stones as a plum
pudding is with raisins.</p>

<p>There was also the barber, a white bearded Turk in a
heavy turban and a robe of gold-colored silk, sitting on
green cushions amid basins and jars of polished copper.
Then, too, there was the amusing Mohammedan who
called to prayer from the white minaret. He came at
certain hours into the tiny balcony that swung out
under the spiked roof of the minaret, took hold of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
ears in a comical manner and uttered a harsh and dismal
shout, which was echoed by the wall of rock behind him.</p>

<p>Far above the point of the minaret towered a cliff, on
the summit of which a battered castle with one square
tower was blocked against the sky. There were strange
tales about the castle, which Rastem learned when he began
to grow up, and here the boys played at the game
of defending the castle against the Turks, sending stones
thundering into the depths of the ravine below as their
ancestors had done in the days of Skanderbeg, when the
Turks had conquered the country, to rule it cruelly for
hundreds of years, until at last, through the great War,
Albania regained her freedom.</p>

<p>The boys realized dimly that something glorious had
happened; but they did not know how great a change
had come over their country, for life in Kruja had not
changed much since the war, except to grow harder.
Every one was poor and wore old clothes, which was a
hardship for the Albanians, who love their gorgeous
costumes. Fortunately they have strong homespun,
which lasts for years. Rastem wore trousers of rough
white woolen material braided with black, a Skanderbeg
jacket, and sandals of cowhide.</p>

<p>A few days before Rastem’s fourteenth birthday his
father found him looking longingly at the gun on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
wall. ‘I am sorry, Rastem,’ he said gravely, ‘that you
and Marko are such friends. It can bring you nothing
but sorrow.’</p>

<p>‘Why sorrow?’ asked Rastem, startled.</p>

<p>‘Why? Because of the feud between us,’ said his
father. ‘It rests with you to clear the family honor.
You don’t take it seriously now, but when you and
Marko are men, either you will shoot him or he will
shoot you.’</p>

<p>‘Shoot Marko? Never!’ exclaimed Rastem with flaming
cheeks and eyes.</p>

<p>‘It is the law of your country and your tribe. You
cannot change it,’ said his father; ‘it is written in the
Canon of Lek.’ And he left the room.</p>

<p>Rastem was angry and excited. All the pleasure in his
gun was gone.</p>

<p>In order to get away from the sight of it, he went into
his mother’s room. It was a homelike place. The wooden
ceiling was painted green, with bunches of flowers.
There was a warm-colored rug on the floor, and a divan
covered with carpets ran the length of one side, under a
row of latticed windows. In the little open cupboards in
the walls Rastem’s mother kept spices and perfumes and
sweets. There were no chairs, but two sides of the room
were skirted by a low platform of brickwork, over
which were spread mats and cushions. On the bricks
stood a brazier of glowing coals. Rastem sat down
cross-legged and spread his hands to the warmth.
The room was fragrant and drowsy. Outside, the rain
slapped against the window and a mass of cloud surging
up from the valley blotted out the world.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The boy was very wretched. He had been taught to
do many things that seem strange to us, but were quite
right to him, such as taking off his shoes when he entered
a house, keeping his hat on at the table, and eating
his mutton and rice with his fingers. So when he was
told by his father that he must shoot his best friend he
had a sickening fear that after all he might be forced to
do it if he could not find a way out.</p>

<p>‘Skanderbeg kept his sword for his enemies,’ he
reasoned, ‘not for his friends.’ Now that Albania was at
last free from the Turks, it would be a fine thing indeed
for Albanians to begin to kill one another! It was unthinkable
that he should shoot Marko. He <i>must</i> find a
way out!</p>

<p>There were the two men from Tirana and Kruja, he
pondered. They had had a feud, but they had sworn a
<i>besa</i> or truce for six weeks, in order to carry out a cattle
deal; and they had laughed together and visited like
good friends. To be sure, when the six weeks were up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
they had shot at each other and one of them had lost two
fingers. Why had they not done business and enjoyed
each other for a longer <i>besa</i>?</p>

<p>And then an idea came to Rastem! He struck his
hands together and rushed out of the house. ‘Marko!’
he called, tearing at the gate. And Marko met him halfway,
under the big olive tree.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Marko,’ said Rastem, ‘why can’t we end
this feud, not by shooting each other, but by swearing
a <i>besa</i> for the rest of our lives? The old quarrel isn’t our
affair, but the <i>besa will be</i>, and we’ve got to keep it. So
long as we do, no one can hurt us.’</p>

<p>‘So long as we keep the <i>besa</i>, no one can hurt us,’ repeated
Marko slowly. ‘Why, of course! Why did we
never think of that, Rastem?’ he cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>Under the olive tree, the two boys clasped hands and
swore eternal friendship while far above them two
mountain eagles circled slowly on flat wings round the
Skanderbeg tower, and through the breaking clouds the
Adriatic gleamed like a streak of silver on the horizon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SKANDERBEG JACKET</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> hundred years ago a boy named George Kastriota
leaned over the wall of his father’s castle and peered into
the depths of the gorge below. He could see a little white
goat far down, just above the line of mist that hid the
bottom of the chasm. She was cropping the fresh leaves
of a bush, which had taken root in a cracked rock.
George watched her, fascinated. Would she try to come
higher? Yes, she did. At least she raised her head. But
when she saw the wall of sheer stone that rose above her,
she flicked her tail and bounded downward instead.
George laughed, and shouted back to his brothers, who
were playing in the courtyard, that not even a goat
could scale the walls! There was a merry romping troop
of children in the castle. How safe they felt up there
under the sky!</p>

<p>Their father was a Prince of the Albanian mountain
tribes who call themselves ‘Men of the Eagles.’ His
fortress stood on the Rock of Kruja, with the mountain
dropping steeply from it. Only on one side a rugged
path led up to the gateway. Over this went and came a
stream of wiry mountain ponies and their riders, bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
provisions and arms and messages to the inmates of
the castle.</p>

<p>Most of them wore short jackets of rough white wool
with tight sleeves to the elbow, large white pompons
in front of their shoulders, and square collars with
fringe, which hung to their waists behind. When it
rained heavily, as it often does on the Rock, they drew
the heavy collars over their heads, crossing the fringe
and holding it firmly between their teeth. This left both
hands free for weapons, and weapons were needed in
those days. Prince Kastriota was away fighting most of
the time, and with him the Men of the Eagles, trying to
press back the Turks who more and more were mastering
the country.</p>

<p>But the people in the castle felt safe, though they
knew there were enemies in the land. George and his
brothers and sisters often played at defending the fortress,
dropping stones over the wall and listening to hear
them thud in the depths, or they amused themselves by
looking down on the village people as they gathered
around the great ‘Kruja,’ or fountain, with their water pots,
and stopped to talk about the army of Turks who
were conquering the lowlands.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_046_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_046_facing.jpg" alt="AN ALBANIAN STORY-TELLER">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">AN ALBANIAN STORY-TELLER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At one corner of the castle a great tower of white
stone stood out against the background of gray rock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
This was the watch-tower. From it the young Kastriotas
could see clear across Albania, from the sharp
mountains, over the hot plain and the steaming marshes
to the sea, which seemed to lie forever in sunshine, no
matter how dark it might be on the Rock.</p>

<p>Every road and trail was visible from the tower, for
the mountains were bare, except where olive groves had
been planted just below the castle. For miles around no
enemy could approach unseen. Sometimes the watchers
saw dark patches moving across the plain, and knew
that they were troops of Turkish soldiers.</p>

<p>So things went for years. At last when George was
nine years old, a terrible thing happened. The dark
patches grew larger and came closer, until the people of
the castle, looking anxiously over the wall, could see
bands of Turkish cavalry driving the Men of the Eagles
before them toward the mountains. On they came,
until Prince Kastriota, riding hard with only a handful
of men, reached the castle to tell his family that Albania
was lost, and that he should have to make such terms as
he could with the Turks; it was useless to try to hold
the castle against them.</p>

<p>The Sultan agreed to let the Prince go on living in the
castle at Kruja, but he would have to give up his four
sons as hostages, and the Albanians would have to pay a
yearly tribute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Kastriota took his boys aside and explained to them
what it meant to be a hostage; that so long as he, their
father, did not rebel against the Sultan, the boys were
safe, but if there should be an uprising in Albania they
would be put to death; also, that if they did not obey
the Sultan and keep faith with him, the Men of the
Eagles would be made to suffer. The boys bravely
promised to play the game, but it must have been a
sad day at Kruja when the Sultan rode away with his
young captives.</p>

<p>The boys were treated honorably; they were given fine
horses, and perhaps they enjoyed much of the journey,
for they were used to hard travel in the saddle, and did
not tire easily. Once beyond the barrier of their own
mountains, they crossed the great tableland of Macedonia,
more open than any country they had known,
where firm roads made by the Romans centuries before
led past cities and castles, and by beautiful churches and
convents built by Bulgarians and Serbs, but now all
under the hand of the Turk.</p>

<p>At last they entered Thrace and came to Adrianople,
where the Sultan lived—if you wish to look for it on
the map you will find it south of Bulgaria. The palace
at Adrianople was very different from the castle at
Kruja. It stood on the hot plain instead of among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
cool mountains, and it was filled with a soft luxury that
did not exist in the home on the Rock. It was beautiful
with marbles and mosaics, with gardens and fountains.
There were rugs and hangings, silks and perfumes such
as George had never before known.</p>

<p>George was a kind, brave boy, quick to learn. He won
the heart of the Sultan, who was kind to him and
brought him up with his own children. He never forgot
his parents on the dear Rock, but since he was only nine
years old when he was taken as a hostage, he soon lost
his homesickness and began to make friends about him.
The Sultan gave him a new name, Skanderbeg, from
<i>Skander</i>, which means Alexander, because the mother of
Alexander the Great had been an Albanian, and <i>beg</i> or
prince, because he was of high rank.</p>

<p>So Skanderbeg began his new life. He learned to ride
and hunt and fight. When he was eighteen years old the
Sultan put him in command of an army and sent him
into Asia Minor, which, you will see, is not far from
Adrianople.</p>

<p>Perhaps Skanderbeg would always have remained the
Sultan’s friend if his brothers had been treated kindly.
But when his father, John Kastriota, died, the Sultan
poisoned all three of them and annexed Albania to his
empire. After that, Skanderbeg went about with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
angry heart under his armor, and when the Sultan had a
new war on his hands and sent the young captain to
fight the Hungarians, he looked for his chance to escape.</p>

<p>He had no quarrel with the Hungarians. All he
wanted was to be free; free to go back to his own people,
whom he now knew to be unhappy and oppressed. He
wanted to escape from the soft life of Adrianople and to
be back in Albania among the rocks and the Men of the
Eagles in their white jackets, helping them to regain
their freedom. In his army there were many Albanians
who, like him, had been taken to Turkey as prisoners
and made to fight for the Sultan. These men joined
Skanderbeg, and together they escaped across Serbia
and through the dangerous mountain passes into Albania.</p>

<p>The people came down from the mountains and
flocked to Skanderbeg. The Turks were driven out of
the country and for twenty-five years—as long as
Skanderbeg lived—Albania was free.</p>

<p>So George Kastriota came back to Kruja to be the
helper and the hero of his people. When he died the
grief of the tribesmen was so great that they dyed their
white jackets black, and so they are worn to this day.</p>

<p>You will see the Skanderbeg jacket everywhere in
Northern Albania—on the shepherds of the hills; on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the men of the many tribes who come riding to market
on their wiry ponies, their deep collars drawn over their
heads to protect them from rain or sun; and on the metal
workers and the farmers of Kruja, who linger about the
great fountain which still gushes out from the rock below
the ruined castle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MIRKO AND MARKO</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mirko</span> and Marko were two gay little Montenegrin pigs.
They had the freedom of the Ivanovitch kitchen, where
they lived in peace and plenty, and as they were plump
and handsome, every one admired them. Zorka alone
did not think of them in terms of bacon and sausage.
To her they were playfellows.</p>

<p>Zorka’s father worked in the sawmill, her grandmother
kept the house, and Zorka kept the pigs. The
length of their life was one bright summer, spent for the
most part with Zorka under spreading beech trees or
along roadways thick with tufted clover.</p>

<p>One evening, as they came home through the shady
village, an old blind man sat in the square singing as he
strummed on a one-stringed fiddle. He was a wandering
minstrel or <i>gouslar</i>, and he sang the deeds of heroes and
the triumph of courage over loss and suffering.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_052_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_052_facing.jpg" alt="ZORKA WITH HER PET PIGS">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">ZORKA WITH HER PET PIGS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The song was as wild and sad as the hills that are
dark with firs, but the villagers crowded about the
singer, for they loved the brave tales of their people, who
had never lost their strip of bare mountain or their freedom.
Zorka tiptoed closer and gazed at the old man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
He had only one eye, but that was as keen as a hawk’s.
A flat skullcap slanted over his gray hair. He wore a
long, dark green coat edged with silver braid, blue knee
breeches and a crimson waistcoat, faded but heavy with
rich embroidery.</p>

<p>Fascinated, Zorka hovered on the edge of the circle,
listening to his shrill chant. The pigs trotted on contentedly
toward home.</p>

<p>On the way their greed led them into a wild adventure.
A plank bridged the swift mill-race, which skirted
the road and led to the watermill on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>The pigs had passed this plank every day of their
lives, and had always longed to cross it, for they could
smell the fresh meal from afar; but if they so much as
pointed their greedy, pink noses in that direction someone
appeared in the doorway brandishing a stick and
Zorka jerked them anxiously back by their tails. Now
Zorka was not with them and there was no one in the
doorway. It stood open, and the sunlight fell on a silvery
heap of meal on the floor under the mill stone. Its
fragrance floated to them. Their stiff little hoofs tapped
across the gangway and they plunged up to their ears
in the soft, delicious mess. Then, as they wallowed blissfully,
there came a sudden <i>whack</i>, <i>whack</i>, on their plump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
backs, and the angry voice of the miller’s wife drowned
their terrified squeals. In a cloud of flying meal they
scurried back over the plank out of reach of the cudgel,
making a bee line for the safety of their own kitchen.</p>

<p>But the miller’s wife had other ways of reaching them
than with a stick. She stopped Zorka’s father as he was
going home to supper. ‘The next time,’ she cried angrily,
‘I’ll cut their throats and hang their hams in the
chimney!’</p>

<p>The threat troubled Zorka’s father, who feared that he
might have to pay for the spoiled meal. He went home
with a deep frown between his brows. ‘That settles it,’
he said, ‘those pigs must go to market to-morrow. They
are as fat as young geese now, and should bring a good
price, but another scrape like to-day’s would wipe out
all the profit.’</p>

<p>Zorka, crossing the threshold, heard the fatal words,
and her heart stood still. The five minutes that she had
spent in listening to the <i>gouslar</i> had perhaps cost the
lives of her playmates. She took her place at the table
speechless with dismay. There was a nice mutton stew,
with beans and gravy, but Zorka could swallow hardly a
mouthful. Her gaze was fixed on two sleek forms sleeping
in the shadow of a bench by the door, their sides
rising and falling peacefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Her father made plans quickly. He himself could not
go to market, for his work at the sawmill kept him, and
the grandmother was too old for the hard journey.
Zorka’s aunt was going, but she had two donkeys laden
with firewood, and a third on which her baby in one
saddlebag would balance a young kid and some turnips
in the other. She could not be expected to look after
two frisky pigs. Zorka must go with her and take Mirko
and Marko safely to the market at Podgoritza.</p>

<p>This filled Zorka’s heart with tumult. The journey
was an event. She had made it only once in her life, and
that once so long ago that she could hardly remember it.
The market town lay almost at the other end of Montenegro.
It would take two days on foot to reach it. They
would have to go down, down from the wooded valley
where the village of Kolashin lay, through bare, rocky
gorges, crossing and recrossing a wild river many times,
with the gray walls of the mountains towering high
above them.</p>

<p>There would be many people going from the village,
and others would join them on the road, coming from
high places in the hills and deep places in the blue
valleys. They would eat their meals along the way—meals
of leeks and milk-white cheese, with black bread,
and sometimes they would stop at a tavern or a friend’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
house to drink thick, sweet Turkish coffee from little
brass cups.</p>

<p>There would be gossip and music and laughter all the
way down to Podgoritza, but Mirko and Marko would
not return from the fair. Their blithe life spent in
hunting for the best fodder along the brook would be
over.</p>

<p>So the next morning big tears stood on Zorka’s cheeks
as she tied a yellow handkerchief over her head and
bound her sandals. She let Mirko and Marko out of
their comfortable pen, fed them an exquisite breakfast
of boiled potatoes and milk, then washed and dried
them before she joined her Aunt Basilika on the edge of
the village. There a group of people were loading their
donkeys under the beech trees. As most of the wood for
building and burning in Montenegro comes from the
Valley of Kolashin and the mountains behind it, many
people were carrying firewood or charcoal for sale.
Others had potatoes or walnuts, eggs and cheese or
great sacks of wool. There were droves of sheep and
goats, and a few cows. The cattle had to be driven
slowly in order not to run all their fat off before they
reached the market.</p>

<p>Mirko and Marko joined the procession in high
spirits. The smell of garden stuff and grain was enticing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
to them, and Zorka had to put them on a string to keep
them from racing ahead under the feet of the donkeys.
Long after the sun had risen for the rest of the world,
the path that the market-goers followed lay in twilight,
for eastward the mountains rose in a sheer wall that
seemed to touch the sky.</p>

<p>In half an hour they had left the cool, green valley
hung like a hammock between wooded mountains, and
were winding their way through a stony land where
there was no sprig of grass, but where the wild pomegranate
bushes springing from crevices splashed their
flame-like blossoms over the rocks. The mountain-sides
were so steep that no soil clung to them, or if any did the
first rushing rain washed it away. Here and there were
what are called pot-holes, where long ago some whirling
stream had kept a stone spinning round and round until
it had ground a hollow in the rock. The stream had
dried up or found a new course, but the hollow remained,
like a stone bowl. Such soil as caught there was not
washed away, as on the slope. People living near such
pockets brought baskets and aprons full of earth and
made precious little gardens of the hollows. Zorka could
look down from the road and count the number of cabbages
and potatoes growing in them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the travelers stopped at a spring to rest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Then Zorka would take Mirko and Marko by turns in
her lap. The little pigs slept soundly, tired out by the
rough trot over a rocky road instead of over the sod that
they were used to.</p>

<p>When night came Aunt Basilika knocked at the door
of a friend who lived near the road. A woman came out,
throwing her arms wide in welcome. She kissed Zorka
and Basilika on both cheeks and pulled the baby joyfully
from the saddlebag.</p>

<p>There was room for the donkeys and the pigs in the
sheepfold, which was a snug cave in the side of the hill.
Shepherd boys brought straw and corn and water, and
when the beasts were comfortable the family went into
the house.</p>

<p>Zorka looked at it in amazement, for it was very different
from her own home. That was built of wood with
a shingled roof and a border of carving below the eaves.
This valley house was of the rough stones of the hillside
without mortar or plaster. The thatched roof was
held in place by logs and stones. There were no windows
and there was no chimney, but the smoke from the
hearth, which was in the middle of the floor, found its
way through the loose weave of the thatch.</p>

<p>The boys built a wood fire and their mother put over
it a pot of soup. They were very poor people, but eager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
to share everything they had with their friends. They
gave them their mattresses, spreading Zorka’s near the
fire; they themselves slept on the ground.</p>

<p>The next night the market-goers camped on the edge
of the town of Podgoritza. Zorka fell asleep to the
stamping and grunting of animals and the jingling of
bridles. At dawn every one was up, preparing coffee and
putting on holiday clothes. Aunt Basilika took a long
black skirt and white linen blouse from her saddlebags.
Over them she wore a long sleeveless coat of robin’s-egg
blue with a border of pale gold balls. She tied a dark
handkerchief over her head, and on it set a tiny skullcap
of black silk. Most of the women wore bright blue
coats that had been a part of their wedding outfit. Their
finery was shabby and faded, for no one had had new
clothes since the war. As for the children who had
outgrown their good garments, they were dressed for
the most part in gunny sacks sewed together with
ravelings.</p>

<p>Zorka was better off. She wore a gray homespun dress
and had an orange-colored handkerchief over her head,
and sandals of cowhide on her feet. The journey from
Kolashin had been so gay that she had forgotten the
purpose of it. Now it came over her with fright.</p>

<p>Mirko and Marko were restless and hungry. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
rooted about, seeking the juicy clover of home in the
sparse grass and weeds of the market place. Zorka
watched them with an aching heart. If she saw a business-like
man approaching, she stood in front of the
little pigs to hide them or gathered them into her lap
drawing her skirt over their heads, determined not to
sell them. But as the day wore on and no one offered a
price for them, she grew indignant. Were they not the
most beautiful pigs in the market? How could anyone
pass them unnoticed?</p>

<p>As evening drew on she began to wonder what her
father would say if she had to take Mirko and Marko
back with her. She knew that he was counting on the
money that they would bring. This was probably the
last chance before spring to sell them. How could they
be fed during the long winter?</p>

<p>Aunt Basilika had only a few fagots left. When those
were sold she would pack her bags with the winter store
that she had purchased, and she and Zorka would climb
into the wooden saddles and begin the long homeward
journey that very night. How would the short fat legs
of Mirko and Marko make the uphill grade?</p>

<p>Twilight was already flooding the Plain of Podgoritza
when a man rode up looking for firewood. Seeing Basilika’s
fagots he went toward her, and then, peering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
through the dusk, exclaimed, ‘Why, it’s Basilika
Ivanova!’</p>

<p>He was an old friend of Zorka’s father, a well-to-do
merchant of Podgoritza. ‘And so this is Ivan’s daughter,’
he said, smiling at Zorka; ‘but what fine pigs you
have! Are they for sale?’</p>

<p>Zorka began to cry. ‘They’re not just pigs,’ she said.
‘They’re Mirko and Marko, and I don’t want them
killed.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t kill such wee piggies,’ said the merchant.
‘They will grow to be grandfathers if you sell them to
me; and I promise you they will live in a fine pen.’</p>

<p>Zorka dried her eyes, and under her breath named
the price that her father had told her to ask. The merchant
counted out silver and copper coins in her hand.
She stowed them carefully away in the pocket of her
petticoat, and then going down on her knees she hugged
each little pig and kissed him on the top of his silly head
before their new owner dropped them into his big saddlebags.
They squealed wildly at first, but when Zorka
patted them they settled down quietly on the straw with
which the bags were lined.</p>

<p>The merchant took an orange and a shilling from his
pocket. ‘Zorka Ivanova,’ he said gently, ‘you have
taken good care of your pigs, and made them worth a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
price.’ With that he rode off in one direction, and soon
Zorka and her aunt had packed their possessions and
were turning in the other. Basilika went lightly, having
sold her wares, but Zorka climbed the mountain with a
pocketful of money, an orange, and a heartache.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TODOR’S BEST CLOTHES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> adventures of Todor began suddenly, one day,
when he was going home from school with a strapful of
books over his shoulder. He had almost reached home
when a dog chasing a white kitten rushed madly from an
alley. Instantly Todor swung his load of books into the
dog’s face. The kitten escaped up a tree, but the angry
dog sprang at Todor tearing his coat and biting his arm.
At that moment two men appeared pursuing the dog,
one with a pistol. There was a sharp crack and the dog
rolled over dead.</p>

<p>‘He was mad!’ cried the frightened men. ‘You’ve no
time to lose, Todor.’</p>

<p>They rushed the boy home, and within an hour,
dressed in his best clothes, with his arm bandaged, he
had boarded an express train for Sofia. His father was
with him. In Bulgaria it is the law that when anyone is
bitten by a mad dog, he must go straight to the Pasteur
Institute in Sofia, for treatment at government
expense.</p>

<p>In Sofia, Todor was placed in a cottage near the hospital,
where he was to live while he took the treatment.
The cottage was kept by a kind woman named Martha,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
who had two boys of her own, Bogdan and Boris. There
Todor’s father left him and went back to his home in
Sliven, a town in Eastern Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Then began a strange and exciting life for Todor.
Never before had he been out of his home town; and
now, except that he had to report every day to the
doctor, he had his time to himself and a great city to
explore. It was jolly to have Bogdan and Boris to talk
things over with in the evening, but they were in school
most of the day. So Todor wandered the streets of
Sofia alone, amazed at the great buildings and the shop
windows full of beautiful things. But sometimes he
glanced uneasily at his clothes, for he realized that he
was differently dressed from the people about him.
Usually, however, he was too much absorbed in what he
saw to think much of what he had on. The Sunday suit
that he wore was the fashion in Sliven. It had the wide,
homespun brown trousers almost like a Dutch boy’s; a
close-fitting sleeveless jacket of brocaded silk, in old
rose, black and white, with handsome silver buttons;
a crimson sash and a jaunty brown woolen cap. When
he could find a flower he stuck it in his belt. In Sofia,
where the men and boys dress much as they do in
America, Todor made a vivid spot of color in the gray
streets, and people noticed the fair-haired boy as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
wandered about alone. And in the end it was his
clothes that helped him most in his adventures.</p>

<p>One day he happened to be passing a schoolhouse just
at recess time, and stopped to watch the boys. He would
never have dreamed that the great beautiful building
was a schoolhouse had it not been for the game of ball
that was going on. As he was watching it excitedly, the
ball flew over the wall, and Todor, springing into the air,
caught it dextrously and hurled it back. A cheer went
up from the boys. ‘Come on in and play!’ they cried,
for they had seen his bright garments over the wall. But
just then the bell rang and the pupils stormed up the
steps, Todor with them, for he wanted to see the inside
of that fine school building. As the boys slipped into
their classrooms, Todor was left alone in the great corridor.
He was stealing away shyly when one of the
masters caught sight of him.</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ he said, ‘you are from Sliven! So am I!’ and he
invited Todor into his classroom, where the pupils were
studying a great raised map of the Balkan Mountains.
It was easy to see how they ran across Bulgaria, nearly
up to the Danube, and down into Macedonia and Greece.
When the master explained that Todor came from Sliven,
his own home town, every one wanted to find it on
the map. There was the famous Pass of the Wild Rose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
too, where the attar of roses is distilled, and where a
great battle for Bulgarian freedom was fought; and there
was Tirnovo, the old capital of the kingdom. Todor
went home much pleased with this, his first adventure.</p>

<p>In the midst of Sofia there is a handsome house with
bright awnings and a beautiful lawn. It stands behind
walls and large trees, but on one side, in a curve of the
street, there is a gate that stands always open, and on
each side of it a soldier in a sentry box. Over the gate
are the arms of Bulgaria, for the house is the home of
Boris, the King.</p>

<p>Todor had a great desire to see the King, and spent
hours on the corner opposite the gate, waiting for him to
appear, but in vain. One morning he took up his post
as usual, and as he did so a young man in gray riding-clothes
came down the drive on a bay horse. He was
slight and kindly-looking, with a clipped black moustache.
As he turned into the street, Todor, bright
against the stone wall, caught his eye. He reined in
quickly, and as he did so his riding-crop slipped to the
ground. Todor sprang forward and handed it up to him.
The man smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you a Sliven boy?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I am, Sir,’ replied Todor.</p>

<p>‘And what are you doing here?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>‘Waiting to see the King come out, Sir.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m the King. Are you satisfied with me?’</p>

<p>‘God keep you, Sir,’ said the lad simply; ‘I had
thought to see you more bravely dressed.’</p>

<p>The King laughed. ‘That’s for the men of Sliven,’ he
said. Then he leaned down and shook hands with Todor,
and was off.</p>

<p>Todor stood rooted to the spot. He had seen the King,
and picked up his riding-whip, had talked with him and
shaken hands!</p>

<p>That was adventure enough for one day. He spent
the afternoon in the vacant lot behind the cottage, telling
the boys of the neighborhood about it.</p>

<p>One day, with a feeling of awe, Todor came in sight
of a great white church with gilded domes. It was all
perfectly new, without a stain of soot or age, and its
marble and gold glistened in the sunlight under the hot
blue sky. Inside, the walls and ceilings were covered
with great paintings and mosaics. Todor tiptoed over
the polished marble floors, subdued by the lofty grandeur
of the place; yet he did not feel like saying his
prayers in it. It was all so new that it seemed to him as
though God had not yet got used to it.</p>

<p>On his way home, passing a dusty square, he turned in
at a gateway in a wall to see what might be behind it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
To his surprise he found himself in a large, quiet courtyard,
on one side of which was a tiny low church. It was
so low that the roof came down almost to the ground,
with only a row of small windows below the eaves.
Through a covered porch, steps led downward to the
church, which was mostly underground.</p>

<p>Todor knew that it had been built long ago when the
Turks had first come into the land and had made it unlawful
for Christians to build their churches more than
a few feet high. There were churches like that all over
Bulgaria. Often, because the people were forbidden to
make the exteriors beautiful, they put all the more loving
thought inside. So in this little church there were a
beautiful screen of carved wood, lovely lamps and soft,
faded hangings on the walls. The stones of the floor were
worn by the knees of many generations.</p>

<p>The little church was empty now, and dusky in the
waning light. Todor, feeling at home there, knelt in a
dim corner. An old man came in, moved about and
went out shutting the door behind him; but until Todor
got up to go, he did not realize that the old man was the
sexton, and that he had locked the church for the night
and gone home for his supper.</p>

<p>Todor banged loudly and called for help, but there
was no reply. He was very near to tears as he went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the end of the porch and crouched there, wondering
what he should do. The church was almost dark now,
lonely and silent as a tomb. Suddenly a rustle in a red
curtain, which hung across a corner, brought his heart
into his mouth. He was sure that the curtain shook, and
now that he fastened his eyes on it, was there not a
bright eye gazing at him through a slit? As he watched
breathlessly, a little old man suddenly popped out a
bald head.</p>

<p>‘So you got locked in, too?’ he chuckled. He came
out and stood before Todor, a dry, wheezy, ragged, old
man, the beggar who sat at the church door during the
day, asking for alms.</p>

<p>‘How can we get out?’ gasped Todor. ‘Help me!’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to get out,’ said the beggar. ‘You see, I
share the Lord’s House with Him.’ With that he brought
out a paper bag, and, settling himself on the flags beside
Todor, took out a lump of bread and some cheese.</p>

<p>‘Do you sleep here?’ asked Todor, amazed.</p>

<p>‘Yes, in summer. It is a safe, quiet place; and the
Lord, being a good, kind God, does not object. He’s
glad to save an old man from the street.’</p>

<p>‘Look here!’ said Todor. ‘Put your hands on your
knees and let me get on your shoulder and see if I can
open a window.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The old man did as Todor requested, but the windows
were as tight as if they had been soldered, and an iron
bar across the middle of each of them would have prevented
Todor from squeezing through even if he could
have opened them. The church was quite dark now,
and after Todor had gone back to the porch disconsolately,
the beggar lighted a candle and with a few drops
of hot wax sealed it to the floor.</p>

<p>‘Have a pear,’ he said, kindly, wiping one on his dirty
sleeve; and Todor, who was thirsty, peeled it carefully
with his pocket knife and ate it with relish. The old
man then began telling Todor stories of the strange
eastern city in which they were staying—stories of
refugees and bandits, of their secret meeting-places, and
their caves in the mountains, until Todor forgot that he
would have to spend the night on the cold stones. But
as they were talking there came the shuffle of feet on the
steps outside, and the murmur of voices.</p>

<p>In a flash the beggar knocked over the candle. ‘Don’t
tell on me, don’t tell on me!’ he squeaked, as he flew
to the curtain.</p>

<p>But Todor was already shaking the door. ‘Let me
out!’ he cried. When the door swung open, there stood
Martha and Bogdan, under the light of the sexton’s lantern.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_070_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">TODOR AND THE SQUASHES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>How had they known where to look for him? It was
because a policeman on duty had noticed Todor’s gay
costume as he turned in at the church that evening. So,
when Martha sent in an alarm, the policeman told her
to go first to the sexton.</p>

<p>As they went home through the hot, dusty night,
Todor was careful to say nothing about the beggar, for
he was sure that the old man would be turned out if it
were known that he slept in the church.</p>

<p>Todor was so grateful to Martha for coming after
him that next morning he said, ‘Let me go to the market
for you to-day. What do you need?’</p>

<p>‘Get me a basket of peppers,’ said Martha, ‘and a
good pink squash—I will bake it for you boys for
supper.’</p>

<p>Todor knew how to select a squash, for he grew
squashes himself. While he was choosing one, an artist
passed through the market.</p>

<p>‘What a picture!’ she cried, as she saw Todor in his
rich costume.</p>

<p>Then, because she did not speak Bulgarian, she found
an interpreter to ask Todor to sit for his picture in a
near-by garden; and Todor, who by this time expected
something new to happen every day, sent his basket of
peppers home by another boy, and tucking the pink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
squash under his arm, set off willingly, wondering what
this new adventure would be like.</p>

<p>By means of signs and a word or two, the artist made
Todor understand that she wished him to pose as if he
were selecting a squash as he had done in the market.
But that was not Todor’s idea of a portrait. When persons
had their pictures taken, they sat down and looked
properly dignified. He was willing to sit against the wall
and hold the squash in his lap, though to his mind a
squash had no place in a picture. But that is how the
artist finally drew him. And what did Todor care
when he saw the five <i>lev</i> piece in his hand at the end of
the sitting?</p>

<p>With a bright smile of thanks he raced off to buy something
to take to his mother when he should go back to
Sliven.</p>

<p>And now, if Todor could see himself in an American
book, he would probably think it the greatest adventure
of all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KOSSOVO DAY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Kossovo Day, the 28th of June. Since sunrise
people had been dancing the <i>kola</i>. Round and round
they went, holding one another’s hands high in the air
and stepping backward and forward with a swaying
movement, as they turned in a great circle to the sound
of a drum and a fiddle.</p>

<p>Any one could take part in the <i>kola</i> when he liked.
He had only to break into the ring, seize the hands of
those next to him, and fall into step; or if he had gone
round until he was dizzy, he could drop out as suddenly
as he pleased, and fling himself on the grass to watch the
fun.</p>

<p>From every little hamlet in the hills the people had
come in their best clothes, bringing baskets of cherries
or cheese or mushrooms to sell in the town; so there were
always new ones to take part when the others were tired.</p>

<p>Peter and Pavlo had started early, in fresh white
linen suits, with gay girdles. Between them they carried
a great basket of cherries slung on a pole. The
money from the sale of the cherries they must take
home, but their grandmother had given them each two
<i>groschen</i> to spend on sweets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>First, however, they went to the schoolhouse, where
the children were assembled to march in procession to
the church. Mary was there too. She had managed to
come, although she had had to bring the baby with her.
Mary’s parents were Serbian, but she had been born in
America and had gone to school there until she was ten
years old. That was nearly a year ago. Then her father
had brought the family back to his Serbian home to see
his old mother. She had written to him in his American
home: ‘The war is over. I live alone. Before I die, bring
the wife and child, whom I have never seen,’ and she
had sent money for the passage. So Mary’s father had
taken her mother and her across the sea. There was no
little brother then. He was born soon afterwards, and
not many months later Mary’s grandmother had died,
and left the cottage and the fruit orchard to her son.
Now it seemed as if they might stay in Serbia.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_074_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_074_facing.jpg" alt="PETER AND PAVLO">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">PETER AND PAVLO</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mary was not happy. She was homesick for her
friends and her school life in Ohio, where she had always
lived. Gutcha, her Serbian home, was a little mountain
village where every one led a simple, out-door life, raising
cattle and sheep and enough corn to make bread for
the family. The house in which Mary lived was better
than most, for it had a roof of tiles instead of thatch;
the floors were of wood, and there was a built-in stove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>of brick and cement. But in Ohio Mary had lived in a
flat with a bathroom, an ice-box and a gas stove in the
kitchen. All those comforts she missed, and it often
seemed to her that they did things in a poor way in
Serbia. Most of all she missed Mamie Barnes. She and
Mamie had begun life together in Kindergarten, and
had been in the same class ever since. Here in Gutcha
Mary did not go to school regularly, because of the baby.
She adored him and had almost sole care of him, but
that care kept her out of school.</p>

<p>The girls in Gutcha were shy and gentle, and stood in
awe of Mary because of her fine clothes and because she
spoke English. She was the only girl in Gutcha who did
not own a distaff and knitting needles. All the others
spent most of their time on the hillsides with the sheep,
spinning and knitting the wool into stockings. They
grew quiet and dreamy, and did not play in the romping
way that had made life a joy in America. Mary
liked the boys better. They were ready for fun, and they
were not so rough and teasing as American boys. Besides,
they honestly admired her.</p>

<p>Mary made herself ready for the Kossovo celebration
with great care. She had heard that it was the Serbian
Fourth of July and she hoped that there might be firecrackers
and ice cream. She put on her white dress with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
embroidered ruffles, which had been bought in a department
store in America, and which her mother had let
down. She tied one big bow in her blue sash, topped her
dark curls with another, and put on her white straw hat.
She wore long white stockings and white shoes, and
looked like any little American girl who was going to
Sunday School. She had put a clean slip on the baby,
and brown sandals with his white socks.</p>

<p>In the school yard Mary waited with the other children.
The crowd of little girls smiled at her but stood
apart, abashed by her elegance. They did not know how
sweet they themselves looked under their pale yellow
kerchiefs, in their beautiful homespun linen chemises
embroidered on sleeves and front, their heavy skirts and
silk aprons, all of such good stuff that only people of
wealth could have bought them in America. They looked
upon Mary as a princess, in her store-made clothes; but
in reality she was a lonely little girl, longing to be friends
and not knowing why the other girls did not like her.
She felt that somehow she was different.</p>

<p>‘Hello!’ cried Peter, briskly, bursting in upon the
girls, and Mary in her heart blessed him for it. The
church bell was ringing now; or rather, since the bell
had been carried off during the war, the priest came to
the church door and banged on a pan with a great key,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
which did just as well. The church was so full that none
of the children could set foot in it, but they all stood in a
line on the grass, and caught the gleam of the women’s
yellow handkerchiefs and the music of strong voices.
After that they were free to go where they would and see
the fun.</p>

<p>Mary put the baby on the grass and joined the dancers.
She liked the plaintive Serbian music; but she felt
that it was sad, and she longed for something rollicking
and gay. How she had loved to spin about on the sidewalk
with Mamie, to the rattle of a hurdy-gurdy!</p>

<p>She soon dropped out from the ring and sat down with
a group of girls to listen to an old man who was singing
and playing the <i>gousle</i>. The <i>gousle</i> is an instrument like
a one-stringed fiddle. It has but a few notes and those
are mournful, but when it is well played, to the airs of
the old Serbian songs, there is something stirring and
heart-searching in it. Mary felt it without being able
to explain it to herself. She was fascinated and troubled,
for though she could not understand all that the old man
sang, it seemed to her to be the tale of a great disaster
connected with the Plain of Kossovo.</p>

<p>‘What is Kossovo?’ she asked the girls about her.
Eagerly they explained, ‘It was a great battle with the
Turks, in which the Serbs were beaten.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>‘Did you say <i>beaten</i>?’ exclaimed Mary, shocked.</p>

<p>‘Terribly,’ said Draga. ‘The King was killed, and all
the country conquered.’</p>

<p>‘But why, then——’ began Mary, but stopped,
afraid of hurting their feelings; evidently they saw
nothing strange in making it the chief holiday of the
year. Later, on the way home, she stopped short in the
street with the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>‘We don’t seem to do things right in Serbia,’ she said
with a troubled face.</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ snapped Peter and Pavlo, who had come
round the corner. ‘What’s the matter? Why?’</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said Mary, confused, ‘in America they have
a great holiday to celebrate a <i>victory</i>. But here we
celebrate a <i>defeat</i>. I don’t like it. <i>We</i> ought to have a
victory day too.’ And Mary began to describe the
American Fourth of July, its flags and ice cream, its
brass bands and processions and fireworks, until it
seemed to the boys that the American children must live
in a perpetual circus.</p>

<p>‘That’s grand,’ said Pavlo, ‘but every country doesn’t
have the same history, and so they don’t have the same
kind of fête days. Grandmother says the reason we keep
Kossovo Day is because, although the Serbian <i>army</i>
was beaten, the Serbian <i>spirit</i> was not. That burned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
brighter and stronger than ever in the day of defeat.
And you can <i>be</i> great, even if you don’t conquer and do
grand things.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that’s so,’ said Mary slowly; ‘I can see that
Serbia <i>is</i> great, and I’m going to be proud of Kossovo
Day!’</p>

<p>That night Mary wrote a long letter to Mamie
Barnes.</p>

<p>‘Dear Mamie,’ it began, ‘We had our Serbian Fourth
of July to-day. I danced the <i>kola</i> with the rest. It’s
easy; there are no fancy steps. But it is too slow. The
women looked lovely! They had strings of great gold
coins on their heads and round their necks. Solid gold!
And jackets of purple and orange, embroidered with
silver and green. It was just like vaudeville. And they
had ribbons fastened to their caps behind, four inches
wide and covered with flowers. The sash ribbons in
Benton’s store can’t touch them. They would make
lovely doll’s dresses and pincushions and things for
Christmas. But there weren’t any fireworks. Just think,
they celebrate a <i>defeat</i> here! At first I thought that was
strange, but Peter’s grandmother says it’s because their
<i>army</i> and not their <i>soul</i> was beaten. And it’s better to <i>be</i>
great than to do great things. I guess that’s harder, too,
because if you’re going to <i>do</i> something you can just go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
ahead and finish it, but if you’re going to <i>be</i> something
you’ve got to <i>be</i> it all the time.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright3">Your loving friend</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Mary</span></p>

<p>P.S. I wish I could go around to Martin’s Drug store
and get an ice-cream soda!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE FAIRY RING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a hot and thirsty day. In the hollow a curving
wellsweep stood guard over a cottage with a thatch,
which, like a rough cap, was pulled down to the two
little eyes of the house. Behind it the hill rose sharply,
steeped in sunshine.</p>

<p>A boy, leading a spotted cow, toiled up the slope, an
empty basket slung over his shoulder. After him
stumbled a girl with a chubby baby in her arms. They
gained the top slowly and sat down under a beech that
spread its horizontal branches close to the ground.</p>

<p>‘He gets more and more heavy every day,’ said the
girl as she rolled the baby over on the grass. The boy
grunted but said nothing. He was lying on his back
gazing idly up into the tree while the spotty cow trailed
her rope through the weeds. The girl rubbed her tired
arms and fanned herself with her apron, scanning the
ground with a practiced eye, for mushrooms.</p>

<p>‘Why, Stefano!’ she exclaimed in an awestruck voice,
‘just look at that!’</p>

<p>‘What?’ asked Stefano, sitting up sleepily. Ileana
was pointing to something on the ground not far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the beech tree. A flash of intelligence came into
the boy’s eyes. ‘A fairy ring!’ he exclaimed, ‘what
luck!’</p>

<p>Among the dead leaves and short grass a circle of
white toadstools had sprung up in the night. It was
what the children called a ‘fairy ring.’ Whatever one
wished for, as he stood inside it, was sure to come
true.</p>

<p>Stefano sprang to his feet. ‘I’m going to wish,’ he
cried, and carefully stepped over the edge of the circle.
He laid his finger on his lips, thinking intently. Then he
shut his eyes. ‘I’ve wished,’ he cried, exultantly, and
leaped out again. ‘Now you go in, Ileana.’</p>

<p>Ileana was flustered by the great opportunity. ‘Oh!
I can’t think,’ she said excitedly. ‘Yes, I know, now;
I’ve got it!’ She stood with her bare feet close together,
her hands behind her, and wished solemnly. Then she
threw herself on the grass beside the baby. ‘It’s all
about you,’ she whispered, kissing him. Stefano did not
hear, but the baby caught one chubby foot in his hand
and laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>‘You’d be surprised if you knew what I wished for,’
said Stefano.</p>

<p>‘What was it?’ asked Ileana, full of curiosity. ‘I
shan’t tell.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>‘It’s something you’d never think of.’</p>

<p>‘Is it something to <i>do</i> or something to <i>have</i>?’ queried
Ileana.</p>

<p>‘Something to <i>do</i>, <i>right now</i>, to-day,’ said Stefano;
‘something you never did in your life.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>please</i>, Stefano, tell me; go on, do!’</p>

<p>‘And I wished it for you, too, Ileana,’ said Stefano,
tantalizingly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how good of you, Stefano. What was it?’ Ileana
was standing breathlessly in front of him now.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said, thinking only how pleased she would
be, ‘I wished we might both ride in an automobile!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Stefano!’ cried Ileana in dismay, ‘now you’ve
told, and it won’t come true! How could you!’</p>

<p>‘What did you ask me for, then?’ cried Stefano
angrily. ‘Now you’ve made me lose my wish while
you’ve kept yours.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I won’t keep it,’ said Ileana generously; ‘I’ll
tell you what it was. I wished that the baby could walk,
so I shouldn’t have to carry him all the time.’</p>

<p>‘Stupid!’ cried Stefano scornfully. ‘How could you
wish such a silly thing as that, and all for yourself, too,
when you might have wished for a bag of gold and we
could have bought everything in the world!’</p>

<p>‘I was in such a hurry,’ said Ileana contritely. ‘It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the first thing that came into my head. But let’s wish
over again,’ she added brightly.</p>

<p>Eagerly they turned to the circle, but while they had
been disputing the spotty cow had trampled it into the
earth.</p>

<p>‘Now see what you’ve done!’ cried Stefano grimly.
‘And we might have had such a lucky day!’</p>

<p>‘But I didn’t do it,’ said Ileana indignantly. ‘The cow
did it.’ She was really very hot and tired, and everything
seemed to be going wrong.</p>

<p>‘Well, come on,’ said Stefano, beginning to feel
ashamed of himself. ‘Perhaps we shall find another.’
He picked up his basket and whacking the cow on the
flank, moved on. With a sigh Ileana gathered up the
baby and followed. His little curls and bright eyes
bobbed over her shoulder as she walked. Ileana was devoted
to the baby. Every morning before she went to
school she washed and dressed and fed him and then laid
him in his swinging cradle, which hung from the ceiling
just over the end of his mother’s bed. On holidays he
was seldom out of her arms, though her slender, growing
body often ached with the weight of him.</p>

<p>Following the footpath through the trees, Stefano and
Ileana soon came upon Branko sitting among the mullen
stalks making melancholy music with the <i>boojum</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
<i>boojum</i> was a great wooden horn, so long that Branko
had to sit and rest one end of it on the ground. Its notes
were sad and heavy, a little like the bellow of a cow.
Branko loved it and blew out his cheeks until they were
crimson. Whenever he came to a brook or a spring he
poured water through the <i>boojum</i>, to make it louder and
sweeter. ‘Hello!’ he cried, as the children came in sight.
‘Where are you going?’</p>

<p>‘To pick plums, if you will take care of Gemma.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said Branko, ‘I will bring her down with
the other cows.’</p>

<p>Stefano and Ileana spread themselves on the grass and
told Branko about the fairy ring.</p>

<p>‘I’ve never seen one,’ said Branko wistfully; ‘what a
chance!’</p>

<p>‘What would you wish for if you <i>did</i> find one?’ asked
Stefano.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Branko slowly, ‘but I think I’d
wish for a house.’</p>

<p>Branko was an orphan. He lived with the schoolmaster
and swept the schoolhouse, besides ringing the
church bells and guarding cattle on holidays. At noon
he always went home with Stefano and Ileana, and
shared their dinner of hot corn on the cob. The great
copper dish of corn stood on the porch and whoever was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
hungry came and got some. But though Branko was
welcome everywhere he had no home of his own. So
now, sitting on the hilltop with Stefano and Ileana and
looking down on the thatched cottages, each with its
golden patch of corn or pumpkins and its haze of smoke,
he felt that a home counted for more than anything else.</p>

<p>They could see the big house at the end of the village,
its gardens and orchards, and below them the schoolhouse.
Not every village in Roumania has its school,
and the children were proud of theirs, though they
wished the lady who lived in the big house, and who had
built the school, would not come so often to see if they
were really in the classroom.</p>

<p>Across the valley there was a gap in the bare hills, like
a piece notched out. That was the Pass. On the other
side of it lay a beautiful mountain country in which was
the king’s palace; but beyond their own valley the children
had never gone.</p>

<p>‘Well, come on,’ said Stefano, at last, ‘let’s look for
plums.’</p>

<p>They came out on the highway, which was lined with
plum trees thick with fruit. It lay on the ground in
purple-blue patches, so that it was not necessary to
shake the trees or to climb them in order to get a
basketful.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe42_0625" id="i_086_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">SHARED THEIR DINNER OF HOT CORN ON THE COB</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The children could see the road as far as the Pass. It
disappeared for long stretches, coming into view again
close to them. Over it there was a slow but continual
passing. Flocks of sheep went by on little tapping hoofs,
and gleaming geese, unruffled by the heat. There were
also wicker carts with small wooden wheels, drawn by
black buffaloes that stretched their flat heads far beyond
their bodies and lifted dumb, sad eyes to the hot sky.
Women with distaffs or painted water-buckets passed,
and the dust rose in clouds about their feet.</p>

<p>But what was that flash? Something bright, like a
great star, had shot through the Pass and disappeared
in a dip of the road.</p>

<p>The children had filled their basket and prepared to
start for home. Ileana popped a plum into her mouth
and picked up the sleeping baby.</p>

<p>Noiselessly two pairs of bare feet fell on the dust, and
the sun wove halos around Stefano with his basket and
Ileana with the baby over her shoulder. A mellow note
sounded behind them. How different from that of the
<i>boojum</i>! Could it be a horn, so soft and sweet? They
turned to look, then scampered to the side of the road,
as the wonderful blinding thing came toward them—an
automobile, like something in a fairy tale, for it seemed
to be of silver. Ileana, her eyes fastened on it, lost her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
footing, and as it flashed by them, fell headlong with the
baby in her arms, into a bed of thistles. A shriek of
indignation and fright went up from the baby. The car
shot past them, stopped, then backed slowly.</p>

<p>‘Are they hurt?’ asked someone anxiously. A man
jumped down from the front seat and came running toward
them. Ileana scrambled to her feet and began patting
and kissing the baby vigorously. All three of the
children were scratched and frightened and covered with
dust, but uninjured.</p>

<p>‘Where do you live?’ asked one of the ladies of
Stefano, who stood his ground, gazing in stupefaction at
the aluminum automobile.</p>

<p>Stefano pulled off his tall sheepskin cap and held it
against his breast, for though the lady wore a bright
knotted handkerchief over her head, as his mother did,
she was different and he felt very shy. ‘We live in the
village opposite the church,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Help them in, Bonnat,’ said the elder of the two
ladies, ‘we will take them home.’</p>

<p>So Stefano and Ileana, with the whimpering baby and
the basket of plums, were lifted into the wonderful
machine. They sat on the edge of the seat, their little
bare toes just touching the carpet. One of the ladies
held out her hands to the baby, but he clung to Ileana.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
The car started with hardly a quiver. Down the road
they darted, the familiar trees and houses flying past
them. Stefano and Ileana, almost forgetting the other
occupants of the car, held hands, their eyes wide with
excitement.</p>

<p>‘We wished for it!’ exclaimed Ileana, at last unable to
keep silence any longer. ‘We wished for it this morning,
and now it’s come true!’</p>

<p>‘Wished for what?’ asked the lady.</p>

<p>‘To ride in an automobile. Stefano wished it in the
fairy ring.’</p>

<p>‘What is your name?’ asked the lady, as she smiled
down at her.</p>

<p>‘Ileana; I was named for a princess,’ she explained
proudly.</p>

<p>‘That is my little girl’s name, too,’ said the lady, and
Ileana noticed that her eyes were laughing. She was a
beautiful lady, dressed as the women of Ileana’s village
dress when they go to church. The sleeves and the front
of her white linen blouse were richly embroidered; her
skirt was a piece of striped woven stuff, red, pale yellow,
and green, brought together in front and lapped over a
white petticoat. Around her waist was a bright girdle,
shot with threads of gold, and on her head was a flowered
kerchief knotted at the back of her neck. From under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
it peeped crisp little curls of gold, and her eyes were blue,
like chicory blossoms when the sun shines through
them.</p>

<p>As the car swept into the village the people came running
to their gates bowing and curtsying.</p>

<p>‘They are surprised to see us riding in an automobile,’
thought Stefano, and threw out his chest.</p>

<p>Their mother, washing clothes in the corner of the
yard, looked up in consternation to see her dusty, disheveled
children descending from the most wonderful car
that had ever been seen in the village. Then, in a flash,
the beautiful lady was gone, disappearing up the road
that led to the big house.</p>

<p>‘Mother, mother, she gave us a ride! She was a nice
lady! I got my wish!’ clamored the children, together.</p>

<p>But their mother rebuked them. ‘Don’t you know
that that was the Queen?’ she said, ‘and you so dirty
and bold!’</p>

<p>‘The Queen!’ they stammered. ‘But she wore a
handkerchief over her head!’</p>

<p>‘And is that all you noticed? Would it make a queen
of me to put on a crown?’</p>

<p>‘I told her I was named for a princess,’ said Ileana,
‘and all the time it was her own little girl, and she knew
it!’ Then, catching a glimpse of the baby, ‘Oh, mother,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
she cried, ‘look at him!’ He stood between the doorstep
and the rainwater tub, balancing himself on his little
bare feet. Then he took a step forward, swerved, dipped,
righted himself, took two steps more and clutched the
edge of the tub triumphantly. His mother, forgetting
the Queen, ran to catch him up and kiss him.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ said Ileana, wisely nodding at Stefano, ‘the
fairy ring <i>did</i> work. If only Branko had wished, too, he
might have his house!’</p>

<p>‘You and Stefano wished for small things,’ said their
mother, ‘but for the big things of life you must work as
well as wish. It is through work that Branko will find
his home.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">GREAT AMBER ROAD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village ended where the forest began. Two great
pine trees stood out like gate-posts, and between them
the road ran into the depths of the wood. Along the
road one summer morning came a herd of cows led by a
small dog and followed by a boy in a white shirt embroidered
in orange and black. He wore a round cap
with a falcon’s feather stuck through the band, and
under his arm he carried a violin. This was Jaroslav, the
village cowherd, who every day, with the help of Flick,
the dog, gathered the cows of the village, led them to
pasture, and brought them back at milking-time. Presently
dog, boy and cows passed between the great pines
and disappeared into the shadow beyond, as if into an
enchanted forest; but if you had waited half an hour you
would have seen them emerge, high upon the mountain-side,
into a clearing of smooth, green fields.</p>

<p>Here a spring ran into a grassy hollow and filled it with
pools of cool water where the cows liked to stand on hot
afternoons. From his perch on the hillside, Jaroslav
could look over the tops of the pines, far down upon the
roof of his own home. It was almost the last house in the
village, made of stone covered with plaster, and painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
by his mother in gay wreaths and patterns. The roof
was of rough thatch on which grew patches of moss and
pink flowers, which danced in the wind. The two white
spots like flecks of silver were pigeons, cooing and
spreading their coral feet on the moss.</p>

<p>The whole village was spread out below like something
embroidered on a green cloth, and across it ran the
thick silver thread of the river. On the farm by the
bridge Jaroslav’s mother must be working in the fields.
Lidka, his sister, was probably putting the house in
order or washing the baby. Jaroslav looked for smoke
from the chimney, but there was none. Perhaps Lidka
was in the garden picking beans. Yes, there was something
red moving. He sprang to his feet, and putting
his hands to his mouth, gave a piercing cry, as he had so
often done when he saw people moving about below.
There was no sign that Lidka had heard him, and with a
sigh Jaroslav settled down to his solitary day with Flick.</p>

<p>It was vacation; otherwise Jaroslav would have been
in school. He was glad to be able to earn something
during the holidays, and it was not hard work looking
after the cows, though neither he nor Flick dared to
drowse during the hot afternoons, for if a cow wandered
among the rocks she might stumble and break a leg.
Jaroslav spent a great deal of time with his violin, playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
over all the tunes he had heard and composing new
ones. The one he liked best he called a Hillside Song.
It began with the sigh of the wind in the pines, then a
bird’s song broke across it and died away. Again, the
wind swept through the trees and brought the cling-clang
of cow bells and the slipping march of cattle winding
their way down the wood path. All this Jaroslav had
tried to put into music. He had worked hard for weeks,
and now he could play it smoothly.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jaroslav brought a book with him. He
loved to read about the heroes of his own land. But
having only one book, and that a heavy one, he preferred
to keep it for Sundays, when he would read aloud
to Lidka and her friends about the great deeds of Czech
men and women. He pondered these stories as he sat
alone until they became very real to him.</p>

<p>First, there was the story of Cech, the founder of the
Bohemian kingdom. More than a thousand years before,
he and his brother Lech had separated from the
rest of their tribe because there was not grazing space
for all their cattle. Through this very country they
must have passed, and perhaps looked up at this very
rock as they followed the course of the river with their
thousands of cattle and horses, their families and household
goods in ox-carts, seeking new homes. On and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
they trekked westward, until they came to the mountain
called ‘Rip,’ which rises like a cone from the
plain.</p>

<p>But what most often filled Jaroslav’s mind was the
story of the ‘Great Amber Road,’ an ancient route that
hundreds of years before even Cech’s time ran from
Pressburg straight up to the Baltic Sea. It had been little
more than a trail for trappers and adventurers, at
first, and led through dark forests full of wild beasts.
But over it passed many traders in search of amber, in
those days a strange, new treasure, found on the shores
of the Baltic. Men risked their lives to get it, as they
risk them now in wild countries for gold, and when they
had found it they sold it at a great price to Roman and
Greek merchants, who had it carved into ornaments and
amulets, and often into cups and bowls, which were
studded with jewels and used in the houses of princes.</p>

<p>Ages before Jaroslav’s time, barbaric people had broken
loose across the country and stopped all trade. The
Romans had disappeared and the Great Amber Road
had been forgotten and stretches of it lost entirely.
Nevertheless it must be there, if only one could find and
follow it, and no doubt at the end there were still beds
of the precious amber. Jaroslav longed to rediscover it,
as men have longed to find the North Pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Flick spent most of the day chasing rabbits. There
were hundreds of them in the fields and along the edge
of the woods. Often they came down to the village and
did great damage in the gardens by destroying the sugar
beets, the lettuce and the cabbages. While Flick was
romping after the rabbits, Jaroslav would grow restless,
put down his violin and climb a tree. Then he would
glance sadly down on the little house, the white pigeons
on the roof, the garden, and the twisted plum tree. Before
the war, life had been gay there. His father had
made a good living by cutting and hauling timber. They
had had a cow and a horse and even a cart. But their
father had gone away with the army; the horse and the
cow had been taken by the Austrians, and though they
had been paid something for the cow, it was not enough
to get another. Their mother had had to buy a goat,
instead. There was far less milk than there used to be,
and no butter at all. When the war was over their father
came back from Russia, sick, and before the year was
out he died.</p>

<p>It had been a very sad year, and it would have been
much sadder except for the baby. It was Lidka who
took care of him and the house, for their mother now
had to work on a big farm, and was gone all day. When
Jaroslav came down from the pastures, he weeded and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
spaded in the garden, because cabbages, potatoes and
beans made a large part of their food.</p>

<p>Jaroslav and Lidka used often to talk of what they
would do when they grew up. Jaroslav would have a
trade and Lidka would make beautiful embroideries.
Thus they would earn enough to make everything easy
for their mother. They talked of the Great Amber
Road, too, and tried to trace on the map where it must
have run. For them the wealth of amber had the fascination
that Captain Kidd’s treasure has had for American
boys and girls. But it took a long time to grow up, and
in the meantime it troubled Jaroslav that he could find
no way of earning more than he did earn by guarding
the village cows. On Saturday night, when he was paid
for the week’s work, he never had more than six or eight
crowns to take home. At such times he thought longingly
of the Great Amber Road and the treasure that he
felt sure lay at the end of it.</p>

<p>To-day was Saturday, and as he looked out over the
sunny landscape he said to himself that there was no use
in merely <i>dreaming</i> of the Great Amber street. He must
really start on his quest if he meant to succeed. ‘I’ll go
to-morrow,’ he said, ‘while Mother and Lidka are at
church. I can take the week’s wage with me, and when
it is gone I will play for my meals.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>He had often noticed a faint streak of roadway between
the hills, running north and south, which he felt
would at least lead him in the direction in which he
wished to go. Now he carefully noted certain landmarks
and decided to find his way to them to-morrow.</p>

<p>That night he received nine crowns fifty, the most he
had ever had for a week’s work, and he went home elated,
rattling the handful of coins in his pockets.</p>

<p>He weeded and hoed in the garden until the great
white moon seemed caught in the top of the pine tree,
for he could not bear the thought that while he was
away the slugs might make an end of the cabbages and
potatoes.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Lidka and his mother went
to church, leaving Jaroslav in charge of the baby. He
took out his Sunday shirt of white linen and his vest of
black cloth, embroidered with silver and green. Then he
brushed his hair carefully. Flick sat thumping his tail.
But the baby, who should have slept, waved his arms in
the air and crowed in a frantic effort to lift his head from
the pillow. Jaroslav took down his violin and rubbed it
tenderly with his sleeve. Then he fell on his knees beside
the cradle and began softly to play the Hillside
Song.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">BEGAN SOFTLY TO PLAY THE HILLSIDE SONG</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The baby grew quiet and looked at Jaroslav with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
wide, dreamy eyes, but Jaroslav turned his head away.
He could not look at the little fellow and think of leaving
him.</p>

<p>The room was very still. Only the voice of the violin
trembled in and out of the shadowy corners, and presently
the baby dropped quietly to sleep.</p>

<p>Jaroslav rose, went to the cupboard, got a large piece
of bread and cheese and some cold potatoes. These he
tied into a clean handkerchief. Then he took a long look
about the room. There were the pendulum clock, the
shelves crowded with gayly painted china, his mother’s
distaff in the corner, the carved chairs and the green porcelain
stove, and on a painted chest several rude little
figures modeled in clay and faintly streaked with color.
They were so old that no one knew who had made them.
Some many-times great-grandmother or great-grandfather
had fashioned them centuries and centuries before,
and had placed them on the hearth to bring good
luck to the family. They were called <i>dedky</i>, or forefathers.
Though no one believed in them any more, yet
no one would think of destroying them or giving them
away. They belonged in the family. When Jaroslav
grew up and married he would take them with him to his
new home, and perhaps for a time he might keep them
on the hearthstone. He looked at them curiously now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
What if he should take them in his pocket? They might
bring him good luck.—But no, they might also be broken
or lost, and that would be dreadful! He did not know
exactly why, but he felt that he would rather leave the
<i>dedky</i> safely at home and trust to his own luck.</p>

<p>He touched the money in his pocket and felt sure of
success. Then it occurred to him that his mother would
need the money more than ever if he were not there to
earn something the next week. So he took it from his
pocket and put it on the table. ‘I have my violin; I
shall not need anything else,’ he said proudly.</p>

<p>On a piece of paper he wrote: ‘Dear Mother: Do not
worry if I don’t come back for several days. It’s all
right. You will be glad in the end that I went.’</p>

<p>He turned for his cap, and Flick sprang to the door.
But when Jaroslav stopped for one last look at the baby
be realized that he ought not to leave him alone. Flick
must stay on guard. This was harder than leaving the
money, for Flick and he always did things together, and
Jaroslav had counted on his company as much as if
Flick had been another boy. ‘Here, Flick,’ he said
softly, ‘on guard!’ But Flick could not believe it. He
waved his tail frantically, snorting and scratching the
door. ‘No, no, Flick, come back!’ said his master, and
Flick, puzzled, and crestfallen, crept back with drooping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
tail and stretched himself beside the cradle. Then Jaroslav
picked up his violin and went out alone.</p>

<p>In a little while his mother and Lidka came home from
church. The baby was safe in his cradle, but there was
only Flick to greet them. Not until she found Jaroslav’s
note did his mother know what to make of his absence.</p>

<p>‘He must have gone to Aunt Ancha for the festival at
Buchlovy,’ she said to Lidka. She was rather vexed that
Jaroslav should have run off like that, for she would
have to tell the neighbors that he would not be there to
take the cows out the next day, and they would be very
cross about it. She made cherry dumplings, as usual on
Sunday, but neither she nor Lidka had much appetite.
After dinner, hearing that the miller was to drive in the
direction of Buchlovy, she decided to go with him and
bring Jaroslav back.</p>

<p>So, while the boy was plodding along the highway,
his mother arrived at Buchlovy and learned that he had
not been there.</p>

<p>‘He is probably walking slowly on account of the
heat,’ said Aunt Ancha. ‘By the time you have rested
and had a cup of coffee he will be here.’</p>

<p>About six o’clock Jaroslav came to a small town
through which a river flowed. On one side of the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
was a hill crowned with an old castle. By the river were
factories, and since the people who worked in them were
free on Sunday, the streets were full of life and movement.</p>

<p>Jaroslav had eaten his luncheon long ago and was
hungry again, but he was too shy to play to the crowd.
It was quite different from the quiet of the woods and
fields, where the only listeners were the rabbits and the
cows. But at last on a corner of the square he stopped
and raised his bow bravely. The strains of the Hillside
Song rose faintly above the clatter of the street, for the
pavement was of cobbles, and people hurried by noisily.
Jaroslav changed from the Hillside Song to dance tunes
and folk-songs, but the crowd were going to a moving-picture
show where there was a band and a gramophone,
so no one paid any attention to the child fiddling on the
corner. At last he stole away unnoticed, with big unshed
tears in his eyes. He did not so much mind being
hungry, but no one had cared for his song and that made
him feel very lonely.</p>

<p>It was twilight on the road when he passed out of the
town. He thought sharply of his mother and Lidka, of
Flick and the baby, and all the dear familiar objects in
the room. ‘I’ll walk all night, so that I can get back
sooner,’ he thought, and quickened his pace and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
bravely on. As darkness came down he began to feel
very tired. His feet burned and his eyes were heavy with
sleep. Besides, he had begun to have misgivings about
his quest. The farther he got from home, the less real
the quest seemed. Those of whom he asked directions
had shaken their heads and said they knew nothing of
the Great Amber Road.</p>

<p>In the blue distance a rapidly moving light appeared.
It must be an automobile. There had been few automobiles
during the war, but now and then one passed
through the village, and Jaroslav had an almost terrified
interest in them. He stepped aside into the bushes to
see this one pass. Just before it reached him there was
a report like the crack of a pistol; the great machine
gasped and sighed helplessly, and then slowed down to a
stop. Jaroslav stood in the shadow and watched breathlessly.
He saw a man get out of the car, open a box at
the side and take out a lantern. After lighting it, with
much grunting and some angry muttering he proceeded
to jack up a wheel and put on a new tire.</p>

<p>All this was of the most vivid interest to Jaroslav. He
had never seen a man quite like this one, and he was a
little afraid. The man looked like one who <i>knew</i> things,
and Jaroslav longed to go forward and ask him about
the Great Amber Road and what he thought of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
whole plan; but he did not know how to speak to this
stocky, gray-haired figure in the linen duster. Nevertheless,
when he saw the man begin to put up his tools,
Jaroslav realized that if he did not make the effort he
would soon have lost his chance forever. An idea came
to him. Putting his violin to his shoulder, he began
softly to play the Hillside Song. This seemed the right
time and place for it, and Jaroslav put his whole soul
into it.</p>

<p>At the first notes the man started and stood up. He
neither moved nor spoke, but stared in the direction
from which the sound came until it floated away over
the lonely road to the dark woods.</p>

<p>‘Hello, there!’ he cried in a strong voice, ‘come out
here!’ He held the lantern at arm’s length and Jaroslav
emerged timidly from the darkness into the circle of
light. What the man saw was a very dusty, tired little
boy with big circles round his eyes and damp dark hair
falling over his forehead. ‘What do you want?’ he demanded
shortly.</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ faltered Jaroslav, ‘are we on the Great Amber
Road?’</p>

<p>‘Great-Grandmother!’ snorted the man, ‘we are on
the road to Brno!’</p>

<p>‘Then I am not going north, after all,’ stammered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Jaroslav, startled by the thought that he would have to
begin his journey all over again.</p>

<p>‘Where do you want to go?’ asked the man.</p>

<p>‘To the Baltic.’</p>

<p>‘To the Baltic! What’s the matter, son?’ he asked,
looking more closely, and then, seeing that the hand
which held the violin trembled, he added kindly, ‘Jump
up and tell me all about it.’</p>

<p>So Jaroslav, who had never been in an automobile,
climbed in, awestruck, and sat down on the soft leather
cushions. Instead of starting the car, the man lighted a
cigar. ‘Run away from home, have you?’ he asked as he
blew out the match. Then Jaroslav began at the beginning,
and told of his father’s illness and death, of the
loss of the cow, the birth of the baby, and the necessity
of his earning enough to help his mother at once without
waiting to grow up; of the amber treasure which seemed
to him the only resource, and of the doubts of his ever
finding it that had come to him as he walked that night.</p>

<p>‘Did you ever hear of the Great Amber Road, Sir?’
asked Jaroslav eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, I’ve heard of it,’ answered the man with a
chuckle, ‘and I know lots of men who are walking up
and down it wearing out shoe leather trying to get rich
quick. But you keep off that road, son! What you need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
is to learn to do something well. The world doesn’t want
amber cups nowadays, and in order to make money you
must give people what they do want, whether it is bricks
or hats or music.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t know how to make anything,’ said
Jaroslav sadly. ‘I would be willing to wait until I was
grown up if only I could get a cow now.’</p>

<p>The man puffed silently for some time. Then he
startled Jaroslav by asking abruptly, ‘Any rabbits
where you live?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes,’ cried Jaroslav, ‘millions of them. They get
into the gardens and they——’</p>

<p>‘That’s good,’ said the man, cutting him short. ‘Now,
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I have a hat factory in Brno,
and I need all the rabbit skins I can get. I’ll buy the cow
and you can catch rabbits for me until she’s paid for.
I’ll take the skins on account. My agent goes through
your part of the country twice a month and he will collect
them. What do you think of that plan, son? Beats
amber, doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Can I really catch enough rabbits to pay for a cow?’
gasped Jaroslav. ‘Then I don’t need to go to the Baltic!’
he cried, shrilly, as the truth burst upon him. ‘I can go
home!’ and seizing his cap he jumped wildly out of the
car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>‘Hold on!’ shouted the man, astonished. ‘Where are
you going?’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to walk all night so that I can begin catching
rabbits to-morrow.’ Then, remembering that he had
not thanked his friend, he began to stammer his happiness.</p>

<p>‘Get in,’ said the man tersely, ‘where do you think
this car is going?’</p>

<p>As they sped through the night on that wonderful
ride, the man told Jaroslav of a school in Brno where
boys learned all sorts of trades, and not only to run cars
like the one they were in, but even to make them. When
Jaroslav got out on the edge of the village, and panted
home in the starlight, his life had taken a definite turn.</p>

<p>But this story is not to tell of how the cow really
arrived in two weeks’ time, or of how Jaroslav gradually
paid for it in rabbit skins, or of how at last he went to
the technical school in Brno. It is to tell only of his
home-coming, of how he reached the house about the
same time as his mother, coming from Buchlovy; of how
she forgave him at sight of his radiant face; of how
Lidka brought him the first summer apples in her apron,
and of how, as he sat on the bench which was built
around the porcelain stove, he told them of his great
adventure. And all the while the baby slept, and Flick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
lay on the floor with his nose between his master’s feet,
and the <i>dedky</i> winked at one another in the candlelight.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Note</i>: It is a fact that an ancient road led from Pressburg (now the capital
of Slovakia) to the Baltic. It was also called Great Amber Road and was
used chiefly by Wendish Traders. The swamp west of Pressburg marked

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LOST BROOK</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Masha came to visit her cousins in the mountains,
Treska thought she had never seen such beautiful clothes
as those that Masha wore, and Masha thought she had
never seen so sad a village as the one in which Treska
lived.</p>

<p>She herself came from a land bright with wheat fields,
where the pink and white poppies grow shoulder high,
and where the little plastered houses are painted gayly
and have red tiled roofs.</p>

<p>Here a cold rain was falling, and the mist swept low
over the forests of black fir. Masha did not know that
the clouds hid beautiful mountains. She saw only their
gray edges, caught and torn on the tops of the dark trees.
The houses were all of wood, unpainted and built like
log cabins, except that they had broad eaves and high
shingled roofs. The battened chinking between the logs
was whitewashed, so that looking down upon the village
as the girls came over the hill it seemed like a collection
of striped black-and-white boxes with pointed covers.</p>

<p>Once inside Treska’s house it was as cosy as possible,
with geraniums in the windows, a pendulum clock,
bright plates on the wall, and blue-and-red checkered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
coverings over the feather beds, which were piled
nearly to the low-beamed ceiling. There were benches
on two sides of the room, and a table set with soup
plates. From the oven came the delicious smell of
huckleberry buns, which Treska’s mother was baking
in honor of Masha’s coming.</p>

<p>Masha was in holiday costume because she had come
on the train. Treska looked her over with envy. She
wore a white linen cap with a broad band of brocaded
ribbon, and a frill of lace round her face. Her collar and
full white sleeves were edged with black embroidery,
and her bodice of crimson and green silk was trimmed
with gold lace. There were bunches of yellow flowers on
her short orange skirt, and with her dark blue apron
heavily embroidered, and a golden and green ribbon
tied about her waist and falling to the hem of her dress
in front, she looked like a big bouquet.</p>

<p>Treska had fine clothes, too, but they were more sober
in color and pattern than Masha’s, and she never wore
them except on grand occasions. Rather shyly she
opened the big painted chest, which stood against the
wall, to show Masha her own pretty things—the gold
beads and netted cap, worked with disks of bright silk,
and the dark cambric handkerchief, which she wore over
it when she went to church, and which was so long that
it covered her flowered bodice like a shawl, and reached
to her scarlet skirt and deep blue apron.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe37_25" id="i_110_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">RATHER SHYLY SHE OPENED THE BIG PAINTED CHEST</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Though Treska went barefooted, her father was by no
means a poor man. He owned large herds of cattle and
flocks of sheep. During the summer months he lived in
a shepherd’s hut across the valley, where he had a great
sheepfold on the edge of the forest. Sometimes the
whole family went to the hut and camped out there for
days at a time. Treska loved that.</p>

<p>The next morning Masha’s aunt suggested that the
two girls should go mushroom hunting for the day and
spend the night at the hut. She gave them a lunch of
black bread and smoked sheep’s-milk cheese and some
poppy-seed cakes. They started off merrily, each carrying
an earthen pot for strawberries.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day. Masha stood speechless at sight
of jagged mountain peaks, glistening with snow in all
their crevices. She had never seen anything so beautiful,
so mysterious and terrible.</p>

<p>Below them spread the blue-black forests, reaching
down to the fields where the patches of grain and corn
and ploughed ground looked like a rag carpet spread
over the hills. The fields were full of flowers and the
mushrooms grew thickly among them along the edges of
the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The pack on Treska’s back began to fill out. At night
the girls would sit by the fire and split the mushrooms
and string them in festoons to dry.</p>

<p>Passing through the fields they met Janko, Treska’s
brother, guarding sheep, and with him Suzanne, a little
girl from their own Village.</p>

<p>‘Come on,’ called Treska. ‘We’re going up the hill to
pick strawberries.’</p>

<p>Janko shook his head. ‘I can’t leave the sheep,’ he
said, swinging his feet as he sat on the fence rail. He was
a licensed shepherd now, and very proud of the brass
badge, which he wore pinned to the front of his tunic
with a long thorn.</p>

<p>But Suzanne joined them and together the three girls
climbed slowly up to a high, cleared piece of land where
the strawberries grew thick and red around the old gray
stumps. Across the clearing slipped a little brook as
clear as the sky, but so hidden that Masha nearly
stepped into it before she saw it. Along its border forget-me-nots
spread a faint blue network over the grass.</p>

<p>Stopping to take a drink, Masha was startled to see
that the brook came suddenly to an end. It did not
spread into a pool, for the grass was quite dry all about
it, and there was no hole visible in the ground. The
brook simply disappeared! Dipping her hand into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
water, Masha felt it drawn gently downward, so it must
be that the brook went underground.</p>

<p>‘Oh! girls,’ she cried, ‘come here! The brook has come
to an end!’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Treska wisely; ‘it must have run into
an underground river. They say there are such rivers in
these mountains—perhaps lakes, too.’</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s like a fairy tale!’ cried Masha, her eyes
bright with excitement. ‘To think of rivers and lakes
and perhaps whole countries underground! I wish we
could go down, too, with the brook.’</p>

<p>After a while they wandered slowly down the hill, the
sun beating hot on their shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Let’s go into the woods and eat our lunch,’ said
Treska.</p>

<p>A path, which came up through the forest, led toward
deep shade, and they followed it. And then something
happened that made them forget all about their lunch,
for turning a bend in the path they came abruptly upon
a tiny hut in the woods, and close to it, in a bare wall of
rock, a deep black cavern.</p>

<p>‘A cave!’ they cried together.</p>

<p>Cautiously they turned toward the entrance. They
saw a vaulted space like the porch of a church, and beyond
it a high wooden gate, which stood ajar. Peering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
between the bars they could make out a long hallway in
the rock, which vanished into darkness, but which had,
as far as they could see, a walk of planks.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said Treska, ‘this must be the famous cave in
the mountain that people come to see. Suzanne, we
ought to show it to Masha. I’m sure you’ve never seen
anything like it, have you, Masha?’</p>

<p>Masha, who came from a flat and rockless country,
never had.</p>

<p>‘But it’s too dark to go far,’ she objected, shrinking
back.</p>

<p>‘Just to the end of this hall,’ coaxed Suzanne. ‘If
there’s a gate and sidewalls there must be something
beyond.’</p>

<p>The three girls slipped through the gate and pattered
timidly into the darkness. A continuous dropping from
the roof wet their shoulders as if they had been caught
in a shower, and their bare feet were soon covered with
mud in spite of the board walk. It was very cold. For
a time the light from the mouth of the cave served to
show them the rocky walls. Then they turned a corner
and felt rather than saw that they had entered a vast
room, for they were staring into a darkness thicker than
that of night. It was warmer here, and the ground was
firm and dry under their feet, but somewhere there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
a dropping of water with never a splash. Except for the
sound, a terrible silence seemed to close in on them.</p>

<p>At last Suzanne could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>‘Hello!’ she cried nervously.</p>

<p>And instantly from all sides came a chorus of voices:
‘Hello! hello! hello!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t!’ gasped Masha.</p>

<p>And ‘Don’t! don’t! don’t!’ cried the walls.</p>

<p>‘Oh, let’s get out,’ whispered Suzanne.</p>

<p>And from the darkness came the startled whisper:
‘Get out! Get out!’</p>

<p>Caught in a nameless terror, the girls fled down the
dark passage, panting for the sunlight, which they could
see glimmering in the distance through the bars. As
they ran their courage mounted until they threw themselves
breathless and laughing against the gate. It held
fast! They jerked. It was locked! Panic-stricken, they
gazed at one another. Then they began to shake the
gate and to scream frantically for help. There was no
answer. The gate had been built to keep people out
of the dangerous cave. It reached to the roof, and
someone had locked it while the girls had been exploring.</p>

<p>‘Let’s go back to the end of the passage, where it is
dry,’ said Treska sensibly. ‘There may be a party of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
people in the cave now, and if there is they must come
out this way. Or others will come this afternoon.’</p>

<p>Treska tried hard to believe what she said, but how
could she tell whether anyone would come that day or
indeed for many days?</p>

<p>‘Of course those were only echoes back there, weren’t
they?’ asked Masha fearfully.</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ said Treska.</p>

<p>At the end of the passage all huddled together to keep
warm. In one direction they could look toward the
patch of light; in the other, into the fathomless blackness
of the cave. As their eyes grew used to the darkness,
they could dimly make out the walls nearest them,
all of white rock, clean and dry as if freshly cut.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sound deep in the cave caught their attention,
and then a faint glow appeared, like a little cloud
at a great distance. As it rapidly increased, the girls
realized that a procession of people carrying lighted
tapers was approaching. They came slowly along a ledge
of rock so high above the girls that it seemed like an
upper floor of the cave. The flickering candles lighted
up glistening walls, sparkling pendants of rock and
strange forms, which struggled out of the shadow; but
the height of the cave was so vast that the top still hung
in darkness. Was the whole mountain hollow, then, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
a melon? The procession wound slowly down a slippery
staircase of wood, the guide leading the way with a big
torch.</p>

<p>Even Masha knew that it was a party of everyday
people, wrapped in warm coats and furs, who had been
visiting the far interior of the cave. As they came forward,
holding their lighted tapers high, more and more
of the wonders of the cave were revealed; gleaming
columns, low-hanging arches and lofty vaulting grew
out of the darkness like parts of a fairy palace.</p>

<p>Clinging together at the entrance, the three little
girls gazed breathlessly at their undreamed-of surroundings,
and Masha, spellbound, saw what looked like a
little frozen brook. It flowed down the wall spreading
out in beautiful seaweed forms along its edges as if
carved in white stone, and from the tip of each leaf
hung a drop as white as a pearl—hung and then, with
a tiny sigh, fell into the shadows below.</p>

<p>‘The lost brook!’ gasped Masha. ‘There it is!’</p>

<p>In her excitement, she had forgotten the strange
people, but her voice startled them, and the guide turned
quickly, throwing the light of his torch full upon the
girls. Shy as wood birds, they stood dumb, and took the
scolding of the astonished guide without trying to explain.
Nothing mattered now. They would be out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the sunlight in a few minutes, and they were thrilled at
the revelation of the vast and beautiful room, on the
threshold of which they had sat unknowingly but a little
while before.</p>

<p>But as the people moved on, the children hurried with
them, forgetting the frozen brook and their own dark
hour in their haste to get back to their world in the sun.</p>

<p>They shot into the light and scampered like rabbits
through the woods. The crickets were chirping in the
grass and the birds in the forest, and the fir trees smelt
like incense in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>‘Why, we are sitting on top of the cave now,’ cried
Masha, as they sat down to their lunch.</p>

<p>‘Oh! the poor little brook!’ she sighed. ‘I wish we
could let it out.’</p>

<p>That evening Treska’s father made a fire on the earthen
floor of the hut, and Janko brought water to fill the black
pot, which hung above it. Masha and Treska peeled
potatoes and spread mushrooms to toast on the hot
stones. From the rafters hung bunches of red peppers
and golden corn, and right over the fire, tied in a white
cloth, was a big cheese in process of being smoked.</p>

<p>‘You mean to say that you have been inside the cave?’
cried Janko, enviously, when the girls had told him of
their adventure. ‘Why, it costs fifteen crowns to enter,
and I have never seen it!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Masha told him of the lost brook, and of how they
had found it again inside the cave.</p>

<p>‘We heard the dropping of its tears long before we
saw it,’ she said. ‘I suppose it went down to explore,
just as we did, and couldn’t get out.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, it didn’t,’ answered Janko stolidly. ‘It was
just running across the field trying to get down to the
big stream in the valley when it came to the hole and
fell in. But,’ he added kindly, seeing Masha’s face fall,
‘if you feel so badly about it, we’ll go up there to-morrow
and turn the course of the brook.’</p>

<p>Masha sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>‘Why, what a splendid idea, Janko!’ she cried. ‘How
did you ever think of it?’</p>

<p>Janko glowed. ‘That’s what we’ll do,’ he said, grandly,
‘I’ll drive the sheep up there to pasture, and we’ll build
a dam and make the brook run down hill on the outside
instead of on the inside.’</p>

<p>And then, because the hut was so small, they all
rushed outside, and joining hands, danced wildly in the
starlight while the potatoes bobbed in the pot and the
sheep bleated drowsily from the fold and the shadows of
the forest crowded closer and closer around them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MICHAEL MAKES UP HIS MIND</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Across</span> the darkening furrows a boy leading a farm horse
plodded home through the twilight. His shoes were
heavy with mud, and his thumbs were so cold that he
blew on them to warm them; for though it was April
there was snow in the air.</p>

<p>Far down on the horizon a tiny light shot out into the
dusk. Michael said to himself that Helen was getting
supper and had just lighted the candle.</p>

<p>When he had stabled the horse in the lean-to, he
opened the door of the shack. A breath of warmth and
three young voices rushed out to greet him. ‘Hello,
Michael!’ ‘Come to supper!’ ‘We’re waiting.’</p>

<p>Michael entered, tracking in much mud, which didn’t
really matter, for the floor was of beaten earth. He
spread his hands to the fire. ‘What have you there?’ he
asked, man-like.</p>

<p>‘Potatoes,’ said Helen, and lifted the lid to show the
silky skins bursting like milkweed pods about to loose
their fleece.</p>

<p>‘But we mustn’t eat the potatoes,’ cried Michael
sharply; ‘we’ve got to save them for seed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>‘What shall we eat, then?’ asked Helen.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t there any flour?’</p>

<p>Helen poked the meal-bag, which hung from the
rafters to keep it from the rats. It was nearly
empty.</p>

<p>Michael’s kind eyes were sombre as the family
gathered at the table. ‘Is there anything we can sell?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘Nothing but the goose,’ said Helen.</p>

<p>They looked at one another with troubled faces. If
they sold the goose, what about the goslings that they
hoped for in the spring?</p>

<p>‘I’ll go over to see the Friends after supper,’ said
Michael. ‘Perhaps Mr. Hall will buy the goose.’ The
four children had been in so many tight places that they
were not easily discouraged. Basil and Katherine were
soon frolicking merrily, but Michael and Helen took
counsel together like old people.</p>

<p>There was little in the room that Michael had not
made with his own hands—the rough table, the two
benches, even the stove of stones and plaster, and the
beds, which were boxes built against the wall and filled
with straw. There was one bed in the kitchen for Helen
and Katherine, and another for Michael and Basil in the
recess, which had once been a cow stall; for the cabin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
was a part of what had been their father’s barn before
the war.</p>

<p>When supper was over, the candle-stump was transferred
to the lantern. Michael, cutting across lots,
would need a light, for the fields were full of ditches and
shell-holes.</p>

<p>The farm lay in the eastern part of Poland, near the
Russian border. During the war it had been a battlefield,
and when, after a year’s wandering, the children,
orphaned, had struggled back to it, they had found
everything except one corner of the barn swept away.
Michael had made it weatherproof with timbers and
stones pulled from the rubbish, and the neighbors,
though shattered and poor themselves, had helped him.
The land was good. Michael knew that in time he could
make a living from it. But he was only fourteen, and in
the meantime there were so many of them to be fed!
The Friends had lent him a horse and cart the first
season, and the community had given him seed. From
the sale of his harvest and by working as house boy for
Mr. Hall, Michael had been able to buy the horse and
was now the proud owner of Boro.</p>

<p>The Society of Friends were a group of people who had
come to Poland from America after the war to help
those whose farms and homes had been destroyed. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
ploughed and built, and they lent horses and tools and
sold seed and supplies at a low figure. In fact, they were
Friends in a very noble sense.</p>

<p>Michael entered the warm room where Mr. Hall sat
writing in the lamplight. ‘Hello, Michael,’ he said.
‘How is business?’</p>

<p>‘Not so good,’ answered the boy soberly. ‘You want
to buy a goose, Mr. Hall?’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t believe I do, Michael. I should like to
sell some goose eggs, instead.’ Then, seeing Michael’s
blank face, he added, ‘Sit down and tell me why you
wish to sell your goose.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall brought in a bowl of apples, and while
Michael ate one he told about the seed potatoes and the
empty meal sack.</p>

<p>‘It would be very foolish to sell your goose, though,’
said Mr. Hall. ‘If you set her on a dozen eggs they will
be worth ten times as much as she is worth, by Christmas.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Michael, heavy with misery. ‘I could
get along, myself, but there are the children.’</p>

<p>‘You have your horse, haven’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, old Boro. He’s good and strong. I have
been ploughing with him all day.’</p>

<p>‘How long shall you need him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>‘To-morrow I shall finish all the land I can plant this
year.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’d like to hire Boro when you don’t need him.
I can use more horses. Will you take a sack of meal and
some goose eggs as part payment?’</p>

<p>Michael went home across the cold fields with a light
heart, and the next day the spring work seemed to begin
in earnest. Helen made pancakes for breakfast, Michael
finished ploughing and began to sow, and Katherine
and Basil filled a box with hay, as a nest for the goose.</p>

<p>Only a few days later Mr. Hall came to Michael with
grave news. ‘My boy,’ he said, ‘I am going to leave
here at the end of this month, and I want you to come
with me.’</p>

<p>‘Going away!’ cried Michael, stupefied.</p>

<p>‘Yes, we are opening a Farm School at Kolpin. It is
for orphaned boys, like yourself, who have land, but
who are too young to work it. By the time they are
eighteen or nineteen and are ready to go back they will
know how to make the most of what they have. I wish
you would come with us.’</p>

<p>Michael grew red with excitement.</p>

<p>‘I’d like to go all right,’ he said, ‘but of course I
couldn’t leave the farm and the children.’</p>

<p>‘Michael, you are very brave, and you did fairly well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
last year, yet you made hardly enough to carry you
through the winter.’</p>

<p>‘I have planted more this year,’ said the boy confidently.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mr. Hall, ‘and each year you will plant a
little more until you are working all your land. But if
you knew something about modern farming you could
make it yield at least four times as much as it does.’</p>

<p>‘How could I?’</p>

<p>‘You would know what to plant in a field one year
in order to get good corn the next; which soil is good for
wheat and which for potatoes; and how to make old land
young.’</p>

<p>‘I’d like it mighty well,’ sighed Michael, ‘but I must
stick to the farm and the children. Mother wanted us to
stay together.’</p>

<p>‘I would not ask you to come if we could not take the
children, too.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ cried Michael in alarm, ‘you said it was a place
for orphans; I promised mother I would never let the
children go to an asylum.’</p>

<p>‘It is a school, not an orphanage,’ said Mr. Hall. ‘The
children would be happy there.’</p>

<p>‘Not if it’s an orphan place,’ said Michael, and shook
his head stubbornly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Mr. Hall could not move him, and at the end of the
month went away sadly, leaving Michael behind.</p>

<p>The boy took up his work with a lonely heart, but he
did not lose courage. He loved every inch of his farm;
the windy furrows against the sky, with the long-tailed
magpies stalking over them; the clump of white birches
in the hollow; the purple woodland and the gray windmill
where he would carry his grain in the autumn to
have it ground into flour. Even the little hump of a
cottage, which he had built with his own hands, had
grown dear to him; but most of all he loved his sisters
and his small brother, and he had the joy of keeping the
family together, as his mother had begged him to do.</p>

<p>One day in early summer, when the crops were pushing
up bravely and the girls were weeding the turnip
patch, Mr. Hall again stood before them. He had come
over from Kolpin for things that had been left behind,
and was to return that afternoon.</p>

<p>‘Can you give me some dinner?’ he called to Helen,
and she ran to put the kettle on. When Michael came
home, at noon, his heart gave a bound of joy. Not only
was he glad to see Mr. Hall, but he was proud to show
him his summer fields.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">BASIL HERDING GEESE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>‘Yes, Michael,’ said Mr. Hall, ‘you have the making of
a great farmer, but you must remember that land in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Poland is no longer farmed as it was before the war. You
will have to compete with modern methods. Now that
we are well started at Kolpin, you must bring the children
and make us a visit. I wish you would come to
stay, Michael. Think it over!’ But Michael could not
make up his mind.</p>

<p>‘If it were not an orphan place——’ he began.</p>

<p>‘Michael,’ said Mr. Hall seriously, ‘your mother
would wish you and the others to go to school. She
would want the girls to learn to cook and sew and keep
house as she did. Do you think it is right for you to
keep them from it? Come back with me to-day, all of
you, and at the end of a week let the younger ones decide
whether they will stay or not. That is only fair. Try
it!’</p>

<p>Michael, who was beginning to see that perhaps he
had no right to decide the question alone, put it to vote.</p>

<p>‘Let’s try it for a week,’ said Helen; and Katherine
and Basil went wild with excitement.</p>

<p>After dinner they all climbed into the farm wagon,
which was half filled with hay, and rolled away merrily
behind the spanking grays. Toward evening they came
to a white house at the end of an avenue of big trees,
where people with kind eyes and kind voices were waiting
for them; but the first thing that they saw as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
drove in was a stork’s nest on the roof of the barn.
Three angular little storks settled down for the night
beneath their mother, while the father stork stood beside
them, dark against the melting gold of sunset.</p>

<p>‘A stork’s nest,’ cried Katherine; ‘this will be a lucky
place!’</p>

<p>‘That is not the only nest here,’ said the House
Mother, ‘come and see the others.’</p>

<p>The first nest was a long, brown house full of big boys
who were just sitting down to a supper of rice with peas,
black bread, cocoa, and apples. Here Michael was to live.</p>

<p>The second nest was a square little house like something
in a story book. Here Helen and Katherine were
to live, with Basil. The floors were as smooth as silk.
At the windows hung daffodil curtains, which made the
rooms seem full of sunshine. There were little white
beds, one for each child, with sheets such as these children
had had when their mother was alive; and in the
kitchen was a great stove, with a chimney-hood like the
one in their old home.</p>

<p>Every one at the farm school was busy. Michael
went out to the fields or to the barns with the other boys.
Helen made beds and washed dishes. Katherine shelled
peas. All passed a part of each day in the schoolroom.
Even Basil learned to count the geese that were placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in his care. He knew that there were eight in all, so if
there were only five in the path there must be three behind
the hedge.</p>

<p>That week Michael watched the children closely. He
knew that they were having better food than he could
give them, and when he saw them starting gayly for the
blackberry patch with their tin pails, or saw Helen in a
clean pink apron watering the foxgloves and hollyhocks
with a happy smile, he nodded wisely. In his own heart
he longed to stay, for he had seen enough of the well-tilled
acres on the river Bug to know that here he could
learn to be a successful farmer.</p>

<p>‘What shall I do with my farm if we stay?’ he asked
Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>‘You may take a week in the spring to plant grain and
another in the fall to harvest it. We can use Boro here.’</p>

<p>At the end of the week Mr. Hall called the family together.
‘Well,’ he said, ‘which is it to be, go or stay?’</p>

<p>‘Stay!’ they shouted joyously.</p>

<p>Michael added, ‘If mother could see us all here I
know she would be glad.’</p>

<p>‘Every one is glad,’ said Mr. Hall. ‘Look!’ and he
pointed toward the barn, where, on the roof-tree they
saw the old stork rise on his toes and clap his beak and
his wings with great content.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ELENA’S CIAMBELLA</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Elena scampered over the road, the town clock struck
a quarter to four. Elena had an important engagement.
Her mother had sent her to draw a jar of water from
the public well outside the town; and on the way back
she was to stop at the bakery to get her <i>ciambella</i>, which
was to come out of the oven at four.</p>

<p>Now a <i>ciambella</i> is an Easter cake, but it is different
from any other cake in the world. It is made of flour
and sugar and olive oil, and tastes like a crisp cooky. If
you are a girl yours will be in the form of a dove; if a boy,
in the form of a galloping horse, with a handle of twisted
dough from mane to tail to carry it by. Whichever it
may be, an Easter egg will be baked inside the <i>ciambella</i>,
and the cake will be stuck full of downy feathers, which
wave and look festive.</p>

<p>Elena’s cake was an unusually large one, in the shape
of a dove, of course, with wings and tail feathers and an
open beak. It had been brought to the bakery on a tray
by Elena’s mother, and left to be baked.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_130_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">HER MOTHER HAD SENT HER TO DRAW A JAR OF WATER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As Elena panted up the hill she saw Giuseppa outside
the <i>cabane</i> or hut, helping her mother with the washing.
The baby stood in a high, narrow box where he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
look on and yet was out of mischief, and there he waved
his arms and shouted with excitement as the suds flew.</p>

<p>‘Where are you going?’ called Giuseppa as Elena
passed.</p>

<p>‘To get my <i>ciambella</i>,’ cried Elena. ‘Have you got
yours?’</p>

<p>Giuseppa shook her head. ‘I’m not going to have
any,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Not this year,’ added her mother, looking up; ‘perhaps
next. But we are going to make the <i>cabane</i> clean for
Easter.’</p>

<p>Giuseppa and Elena looked at each other sympathetically.</p>

<p>‘Too bad!’ exclaimed Elena. ‘Well I must hurry.
<i>Ciao</i>, Giuseppa.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Ciao</i>, Elena.’ (A parting that is pronounced ‘chow’
and means good-bye.)</p>

<p>When Elena reached the bakery she found a great
crowd there. The four o’clock cakes were coming out of
the oven. Far back in the glow Elena could see her own
<i>ciambella</i> on the stone floor of the oven, larger than all
the rest, its feathers waving tantalizingly in the heat.</p>

<p>In the midst of the women and children stood the
cook, with smooth black hair and huge earrings of gold
and pearls, which reached to her shoulders, and with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
clean flowered kerchief tucked into her corset. She was
bare-armed and brown, and held what looked like a
great pancake-turner with a very long handle. With
this she could reach into the depths of the oven, which
was as big as a pantry, and scoop out the cakes, even
those quite at the back. There were all sorts of cakes,
large and small; some were cookies, and some were big
loaves made with almonds and honey and eggs. The
whole place smelt delicious, and every one stood on tiptoe
to see his own cake pulled out of the oven. Finally
Elena’s <i>ciambella</i> was put into her hands, still hot and
fragrant, though she had waited for it to cool somewhat
on a tray.</p>

<p>Just then a little girl named Letitia came in to ask for
coals with which to light the fire at home. The cook
raked a few from the oven and put them into the pot of
ashes that Letitia carried. Covering them with her
apron, Letitia went out with Elena.</p>

<p>‘Just look at my <i>ciambella</i>,’ said Elena proudly, as
she carried it carefully on both hands. ‘Isn’t it a beauty?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Letitia, ‘I am going to have one, too. It
will be baked to-morrow. Of course,’ she added, ‘it
won’t be quite as big as yours, because Maria will have
one and Gino will have a horse. But they’ll all taste the
same.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>‘Just think!’ said Elena, ‘Giuseppa isn’t going to have
any at all.’</p>

<p>‘Not any?’ cried Letitia. ‘How dreadful! I never
heard of a house without a <i>ciambella</i>! They must be
very poor.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but at school Giuseppa always has a clean
apron and clean hands. She helps her mother a lot, too.
Well, chow, Letitia.’</p>

<p>‘Chow, Elena.’</p>

<p>The girls parted, and Elena walked proudly through
the streets, carrying the cake as though in a procession.</p>

<p>She climbed the outside stair, which led to her house,
built over the donkey stable. Her mother had gone out
to the fountain to polish her pots. The big dim room,
with its brown rafters and the dark furniture ranged
along the walls, was very quiet. A patch of sunshine
made a bright spot on the stone floor, and in it a white
pigeon drowsed. It did not move, even when Elena
stepped over it. The little girl looked down and laughed
at the comical resemblance between the pigeon and her
<i>ciambella</i>; but her own pigeon sat up very straight and
stiff, because it had an Easter egg baked inside it.</p>

<p>Elena set the cake carefully on a big chest while she
struggled to open the bottom drawer of the bureau.
There she laid the cake in a nest of clean aprons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
handkerchiefs, to rest until Saturday afternoon, when
it would be taken out to be blessed. Not until Sunday
morning would its fine feathers be plucked and its crisp
wings bitten off.</p>

<p>The <i>ciambella</i> safely lodged in the drawer, Elena
climbed on a chair and got a piece of bread and some
sheep’s cheese from the cupboard; then she ran to find
her mother.</p>

<p>The next days were very busy. Every one in Sezze
was cleaning house frantically before Easter. Washing
hung over every balcony, the yellow and flowered handkerchiefs
and aprons making the whole street gay.
Every bit of furniture was polished, windows were
cleaned, curtains washed and floors scrubbed. Above
all, the copper water jars and basins were taken out to
the fountains and scoured with lemon and sand until
they shone like red gold. There was the warmth of
spring in the air after a cold winter. On the slopes below
the town the almond trees were in blossom and the
snow had disappeared from the mountains, the tops of
which were drifted with clouds.</p>

<p>Far below the town a fertile plain—the Pontine
Marshes—stretched out to the sea. Often the plain was
covered with mists, for it was full of swamps that bred
mosquitoes and malaria. People who lived there did so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
at a risk. Often they came up to the town sick with
fever, and sometimes they died; but the gardens and
fields produced such fine vegetables and brought so
much money from the markets in Rome that men kept
on. There were no houses down there, so far as the eye
could see, only <i>cabanes</i> or huts thatched with reeds from
the marshes and in the distance looking like haystacks.
Giuseppa’s father worked on the flats, and the family
lived in a <i>cabane</i>, but it was high up on the mountain,
just below the town, where land was cheap.</p>

<p>It was true that Giuseppa’s father was very poor, but
he was also saving his money to build a little stone house
to take the place of the <i>cabane</i>. He told the children
that when they had the house they should also have a
<i>ciambella</i> every year. In the meantime Giuseppa helped
her mother to make the <i>cabane</i> as neat as possible for
Easter. It was a poor place indeed; round, with a
thatched roof, which came to a peak at the top. Inside
there was only one room, and that had an earthen floor
and no windows. There was no opening except the
doors, and no chimney.</p>

<p>When the fire was built on the floor in the middle of
the room the smoke struggled up through holes in the
roof; but the family lived out in the sun most of the time,
and went into the <i>cabane</i> only when it rained or was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
very cold. As Elena went back and forth for water those
busy days she sometimes looked over the wall and saw
Giuseppa hanging clothes on the bushes or beating a
mattress; and there was smoke coming through the roof
as if water was being heated. Elena felt very sorry for
Giuseppa, and every night prayed God to send her a
<i>ciambella</i>.</p>

<p>Giuseppa, not knowing this, felt bitter toward Elena
and jealous of her great, feathered cake. Also she herself
prayed earnestly for a <i>ciambella</i>. On Easter morning
she made herself as fine as she could, and went to
church. She combed back her short hair and laid a
white embroidered handkerchief over it. She had small
gold earrings and a coral necklace, and she put on a light
blue cotton apron and her corn-colored handkerchief
with roses, over her shoulders.</p>

<p>On her way home Elena came running after her. ‘Oh,
Giuseppa,’ she asked earnestly, ‘did you get a <i>ciambella</i>?’</p>

<p>‘No, I didn’t,’ said Giuseppa, and passed on.</p>

<p>Elena was much disappointed. She had prayed hard,
and felt that a cake should have been sent to Giuseppa.
Then suddenly she stopped short in the street. ‘Why,’
she said, ‘perhaps God hasn’t got a <i>ciambella</i>, and I
have!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>She went home thoughtfully and opened the drawer
and looked a long time at her <i>ciambella</i>. Then she ate
her dinner of boiled chicken, and artichokes fried in
batter. After dinner Elena took the cake lovingly in her
arms and carried it into the street. It was the last time
it would be on parade. She passed the groups of children,
all munching <i>ciambella</i>, and made her way to
Giuseppa’s hut. Giuseppa was outside, feeding the baby
from a bowl of bread and milk.</p>

<p>‘Happy Easter!’ cried Elena.</p>

<p>‘Happy Easter!’ replied Giuseppa, her eyes fixed on
the cake.</p>

<p>‘I brought my <i>ciambella</i> to eat with you,’ said Elena
cautiously, ‘and you may hold it, and, oh, Giuseppa,
you may have the egg!’</p>

<p>Giuseppa grew scarlet. ‘I never saw such a beauty,’
she said, ‘and what feathers!’</p>

<p>‘I stuck them into the dough myself;’ said Elena,
‘that is why there are so many.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know,’ said Giuseppa shyly, ‘I <i>prayed</i> for a
<i>ciambella</i>.’</p>

<p>‘And you got it!’ cried Elena triumphantly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN EVERYDAY STORY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Michel</span> trudged home to supper. All day he had been
forking heavy, slippery seaweed into carts. His arms
and legs ached, but he had earned five francs. That
would be something to tell Uncle Ives when he got back
from his cruise to the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>The seaweed, washed up on the beach by a month’s
storm, was community property, prized as fertilizer and
as bedding for the live stock. The mayor had appointed
a day for each family to gather its share, and Michel
had been hired by an absent citizen to harvest his part
of this strange sea crop.</p>

<p>As he started home, the world, hitherto wrapped in a
golden mist, began to darken; and looking at the sky,
Michel was surprised to see a great mounting cloud,
which had not been there a few moments before. As he
opened the cottage door, it was nearly jerked from his
hand by a sudden gust. He dropped his wooden shoes
at the door, and entered the kitchen in his felt slippers.</p>

<p>His grandmother sat near the fireplace, giving little
Martha her supper. On the hearthstone knelt Guen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
There was an appetizing smell of frying fish. Now and
then a drop of rain came down the chimney and splashing
into the pan, made a great sizzling. The wooden
shutters, closing with a bang, shut out the last glimmer
of twilight. ‘Go out, Michel, and fasten them open,’ said
Grandmother; ‘we will keep the lamp in the window to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad Uncle Ives got off the coast before the
storm came,’ said Guen. ‘Don’t you suppose the Jeanot
is in the Bay of Biscay by this time, Grandmother?’</p>

<p>‘God knows,’ sighed the old woman. She turned the
fish in the pan, Josef came in red-cheeked and muddy
from a game of ball, and they had supper.</p>

<p>The bed in which Michel and Josef slept was built
into the wall and heaped with pillows and bedding. It
had sliding doors, which could be closed, so that it
looked like a handsome carved wardrobe; but usually
they were left open, showing the pretty chintz curtains.
That night when Michel, sitting on Uncle Ives’s sea
chest, pulled off his stockings, the storm was raging
around the little stone house like a howling wolf. But
the four children slept like dormice under their feather
beds. Only grandmother, peering between her curtains,
watched the flickering lamp all night long.</p>

<p>Michel had never been beyond the smell of the sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and there was brine in his blood. He knew that sooner
or later he, too, like his father and all his forebears,
would become an Iceland fisherman; in fact he lived for
the day when, as <i>mousse</i> or cabin boy, he would take
ship under his Uncle Ives for the Arctic Circle; for
Michel lived in the town of Paimpol, in that part of
Brittany called the <i>Côte du Nord</i>. From this port every
year in March a fishing fleet sails for northern waters,
to return in August for a few weeks’ respite before starting
for the Bay of Biscay to buy salt for the next year’s
catch. Toward September those who have not slipped
forever into the silence of the North are back in their
homes for the cozy winter months, there to make ready
for a fresh voyage in the spring. But there are always
some for whom there is only a tablet in the gray church
by the sea, like the one for Michel’s father, ‘Jules
Karadoc, lost on the Iceland Coast’; and under the darkened
rafters hangs the model of many a brave little
ship gone down.</p>

<p>For the people of Brittany storm and shipwreck are
things of every day. They work and eat and sleep as
usual, but the women, who do not go to sea, learn to sigh
with the wind and to pray as they work.</p>

<p>The next morning, after Josef and Guen had gone to
school, Michel, taking a pail, ran down to the beach for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
clams. The sun was shining again, the tide was out,
and only the banks of seaweed and the driftwood
flung high on the beach gave any sign of last night’s
storm.</p>

<p>Michel dug busily for clams, detecting their presence
with the keenness of experience, and then with a full
pail started homeward. As he skirted the town, the
clack of many wooden shoes hurrying over the cobbles
caught his ear. A crowd was running through the streets.
Full of curiosity, Michel ran too, headlong for the square
in the center of the town.</p>

<p>The wooden shoes were still thumping in from all
sides, and about the telegraph office pressed a silent
group of women, the tragedy of the sea written on their
faces. No one spoke. Only the rapid click of the telegraph
key came through the open door. Then a man
appeared, holding high a bit of paper.</p>

<p>‘Susanne Allanic,’ he called; and added quickly,
‘Your man’s safe!’</p>

<p>Susanne, standing on the edge of the crowd, with a
baby in her arms, threw up her head, gave a cry, and
broke into sobs.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter?’ asked Michel sharply, for Allanic
was one of the Jeanot’s crew.</p>

<p>‘The Jeanot’s gone down,’ said a woman breathlessly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
‘four men are missing. We don’t know who they
are.’</p>

<p>Michel stood stunned. The sunlight seemed suddenly
wiped from the world. ‘The Jeanot’s gone down! The
Jeanot’s gone down!’ kept pounding through his brain.
He knew he should have to tell his grandmother, and
in just those words; he could think of no others. At the
gate he met her. Her face was as white as his own, and
he knew that she had heard.</p>

<p>‘The Jeanot——’ he stammered, trembling.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said his grandmother, ‘but Ives will telegraph.’
And she took the pail of clams from him and
went into the house to make the chowder.</p>

<p>They all knew now that last night’s storm was but
the spent end of a great tempest, which had swept the
coast from Spain northward, and that the Jeanot,
struggling to keep to the open sea, had been forced on
the rocks below the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>From obscure Spanish towns the belated telegrams
kept coming in all that week. Three bodies had been
washed ashore, and eleven men were accounted for;
only Ives Karadoc was missing. Some sailors had come
home with the story of the wreck. After the break-up
of the Jeanot, Ives had been seen clinging to a floating
barrel. That was the last known of him. So the days
dragged on, hollow and dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>People went back to their daily affairs, and began to
talk of other things than the wreck of the Jeanot. But
in Michel’s home things were not as before. Laughter
had died away from the hearthstone. A knock or a
strange step on the flags set their hearts beating,
and every night the little lamp burned in the window.</p>

<p>‘Ives has been picked up and taken to some far
country,’ persisted Grandmother. ‘We shall hear, we
shall hear.’ But one morning Michel, finding her all in
a heap near the fireplace, weeping with her apron over
her head, knew that she had lost hope.</p>

<p>He himself could not give up, and with hot protest in
his heart he started for the headland beyond the village
where one could look far out to sea. It was the point
where they had all gathered to watch for the Iceland
fleet when it had returned less than a month ago, the
Jeanot leading, her sails agleam in the setting sun. And
now the Jeanot had gone down! Why, she was as
familiar and friendly and dear as the kitchen itself! And
Uncle Ives was such a jolly young uncle, so full of understanding!
The children adored him. Last year at this
time they had begun to fill the sea chest for his first voyage
with the Iceland fleet. Together they had saved
their pennies to buy sweet, sticky ginger and chocolate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and biscuits to tuck into the corners as surprises. Guen
had knit socks and hemmed towels. Grandmother had
made the underclothing. Finally, together, they had
fashioned the tarpaulins, which were to keep Uncle Ives
dry in the worst of storms. Grandmother had cut and
sewed them on the machine with three and four rows of
stitching. Then they had dipped them in oil; and the
children had dragged them out to the hillside and
spread them on the bushes to dry, weighting them down
with stones, turning them to the sun and the wind,
bringing them out each day anew and taking them in
at night. At last the three coatings of oil were dry, and
the suit was light and tough and waterproof. How they
had laughed when Uncle Ives had tried it on, and had
pulled the huge stocking feet of the trousers over his
boots! Before he sailed he had asked them what they
wished him to bring them from Iceland, just as the
father of the three daughters in the fairy story did.
They could not say, not knowing what things there
might be in Iceland; but Ives had brought walrus teeth
to the boys, a sack of eiderdown to Grandmother, and
dolls in quaint native costume to the girls. And then,
just as they thought they had him back again, he had
started off with the Jeanot to buy salt for next year’s
catch!</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>They had waved good-bye to him, and watched until
the Jeanot was a white fleck beyond the islands. Now
all that was bright in life seemed to have been dashed to
pieces on the black rocks of Biscay.</p>

<p>Michel pushed his way through the gorse, which
pricked thickly about him. At the summit of the headland
stood a great stone cross, its carvings worn by
centuries of wind and brine. Here women who had
waited long for men at sea came to pray. On the step,
with his cap pressed to his breast, Michel knelt. His
heart was too full to pray in words. Besides, what could
he say if God did not already know how much he wanted
Uncle Ives back?</p>

<p>Below him spread the bay, a sweep of pale gold. Tiny
islands, rose and lavender, or velvety black where the
seaweed clung to them, studded the surface like gems.
A row of twisted pine trees followed the line of the opposite
shore.</p>

<p>After a while Michel stood up, and shading his eyes,
gazed seaward. There where the straits led into the
open channel lay the Isle of Breha, and round its point
came the Paimpol fishing fleet returning for the night.
As they drew nearer Michel could distinguish each boat
by some well-known mark as one can tell a neighbor’s
cow by a crumpled horn or the white patches on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
flanks. There was the high curved prow of Raoul’s boat,
a black and green trawler. There was the orange patch
on Jean Baptiste’s gray sail. Among the well-known
boats there was a stranger with tawny sails and a bulky
hull larger than the rest. What boat was that? Pricked
by a boy’s curiosity, Michel forgot his grief. If he raced
back by way of the beach he might reach the wharf almost
as soon as the boats reached it.</p>

<p>Slipping and crashing down the hillside, he came to
the beach and thudded over the sands in his wooden
shoes. When he reached Paimpol the boats were already
moored. A crowd had gathered, and Michel
could see confusedly that sailors were carrying someone
on a stretcher from the strange boat.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from the crowd. Michel, dodging
under elbows, squirmed his way nimbly to the inner
circle. He could see a form wrapped in blankets on
the stretcher, around which the men were pressing
eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Is it a rescue?’ he asked, for such things often happened.</p>

<p>‘Hello, old pal!’ cried a familiar voice, and Michel
stood speechless. The darkness seemed to fall from him,
and the world to become real again, all his broken courage
coming back to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>‘Hello, Uncle Ives!’ he cried, his voice high with excitement.
‘I didn’t believe you were dead.’ And then
all at once he knew how terribly afraid he had been.
‘But Grandmother did,’ he continued. His chin
quivered, and great tears fell on the wharf.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Michel,’ said Uncle Ives softly, ‘you cut
ahead and tell her there’s nothing the matter with me
but a broken leg.’</p>

<p>And so Michel was the swift forerunner of the triumphant
procession that wound from the landing to the
Karadoc cottage.</p>

<p>No one heard a word of Uncle Ives’s story that night.
Grandmother sent them all to bed earlier than usual,
and closed the door on eager neighbors. But the next
day in the sunny garden, where bees bobbed in and out
of the honeysuckle, they heard of the dark night when
the Jeanot had gone down in a crash of wind and foam,
and of the miracle by which Uncle Ives, clinging to an
empty salt keg, had been drawn away from the rocks
by the ebbing tide. He had been unconscious when a
fishing boat had picked him up the next day, and one
leg was broken from a blow of which he knew nothing.
The fishing boat was bound to Honfleur on the French
Coast, but had changed its course to bring the wounded
man home. The dear ship Jeanot was mourned with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
many tears. Devoutly Michel and Josef carved a model
of her, and rigged it. They took it to the little gray
church by the sea, where, with innumerable others, it
hangs in the dim shadows of the roof, a thank-offering
for the safe return of Uncle Ives.</p>
